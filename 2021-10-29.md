### Media types and JSON Schemas

Media types to handle versioning of resource schemas and alternates (sidecars)
for the same dataset.  For example (doesn't have to be exactly this):

| Media type                                          | JSON Schema                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------|
| application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.main+json             | augur/data/schema-export-v2.json      |
| application/vnd.nextstrain.v1.meta+json             | augur/data/schema-export-v1-meta.json |
| application/vnd.nextstrain.v1.tree+json             | augur/data/schema-export-v1-tree.json |
| application/vnd.nextstrain.vX.root-sequence+json    | [need to author]                      |
| application/vnd.nextstrain.vY.tip-frequencies+json  | [need to author]                      |

The `application/‚Ä¶+json` syntax is a standard that means "the container format
is application/json".  Almost like subclassing a media type.  `vnd` means
"vendor" and is also a standard.

Fine to keep maintaining these schemas in Augur's repo, but publish them
somewhere predictable and reliable so they can be programmatically referred to
without concern for how/where they're maintained, e.g.
<https://data.nextstrain.org/schemas/augur-export-v2.json>.

Versioning means both that clients can indicate what they want and the server
can indicate what it's returning, even before inspecting the data contents
itself.

### Endpoints

Use existing endpoints (when possible) or slight variations rather than define
wholly new ones.

Provide full, structured functionality for programs using content negotiation,
while also providing convenience routes for humans.  Routes easily map to the
same endpoint functions in the server, so maintenance burden of parallel
routes is minimal.

#### Datasets and narratives

Using `/groups/‚Ä¶` for examples, but if we want this pattern also works fully
for core and staging and with limited read-only functionality for
`/community/‚Ä¶` and `/fetch/‚Ä¶`.

Basic CRUD via:

  - /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A
    - GET
      - Accept: application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.main+json
      - Accept: application/vnd.nextstrain.vX.root-sequence+json
      - Accept: application/vnd.nextstrain.vY.tip-frequencies+json
    - PUT
      - Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.main+json
      - Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.vX.root-sequence+json
      - Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.vY.tip-frequencies+json
    - DELETE

Optional convenience routes for humans (and client programs that don't benefit
from additional structure):

    /groups/:groupName/*.json
    /groups/:groupName/*_:sidecar(root-sequence|tip-frequencies).json

    Examples:
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A.json
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A_root-sequence.json
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A_tip-frequencies.json

<details>
  <summary>(Alternatively‚Ä¶)</summary>

    /groups/:groupName/*/:subresource(main|root-sequence|tip-frequencies).json

    Examples:
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A/main.json
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A/root-sequence.json
      /groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A/tip-frequencies.json

</details>

These convenience routes would always return the latest schema versions and
don't require content negotiation.

The convenience routes also present the possibility for Auspice to optionally
use them to enable for true static, standalone sites (e.g. GitHub Pages, S3,
Netlify, etc) by laying out the filesystem like so:

    groups/
      blab/
        ncov/
          early-outbreak/
            root-A/
              index.html (Auspice entrypoint)
            root-A.json
            root-A_root-sequence.json
            root-A_tip-frequencies.json

<details>
  <summary>(Alternatively‚Ä¶)</summary>

    groups/
      blab/
        ncov/
          early-outbreak/
            root-A/
              index.html (Auspice entrypoint)
              main.json
              root-sequence.json
              tip-frequencies.json

</details>

For structured API clients, [`Link` headers][] can be sent identifying the alternates:

    Link: </groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A>; rel=alternate; type=application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.main+json,
          </groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A>; rel=alternate; type=application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.root-sequence+json,
          </groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A>; rel=alternate; type=application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.tip-frequencies+json

which can be used to make more resilient clients.
