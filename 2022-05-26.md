# or, …

- CLI install and setup
  - pyoxidizer + short installer (bash)
    - install into ~/.local/nextstrain/ or ~/.nextstrain/ or similar?
    - installer could be bundled by putting it in front of the zipped pyoxidizer assets
    - installer could be
      - bash
        - straightforward
      - Python
        - also bootstrapped by pyoxidizer?
        - but this then bundles two static Pythons, which is not great for
          download size.
        - unless we can re-use the same static Python?

  - `nextstrain setup`
    - `--runtime=docker`
    - `--runtime=conda`

- Runtimes
  - Rename "native" to "ambient"
  - Conda runtime
    - Managed Conda env, largely hidden away from user
    - Built upon "ambient" runtime after Conda activation
  - Docs!

- Updating CLI and runtimes
  - extend `nextstrain update`
    - Modes
      - `--runtime` by default
      - `--cli` optionally
      - `--all`

    - `nextstrain update {runtime, cli}`

  - new noun-first commands
    - `nextstrain runtime update`
      - only default runtime by default
      - but can switch with `--runtime=X`

    - `nextstrain cli update`
      - nah, super confusing

- Buildpacks
  - `nextstrain pack` (name is meh!)
    - `pack build`: makes an image (similar to docker build)
    - `pack publish`: publish image (similar to docker push)

    - maybe `nextstrain workflow pack` and `publish` or something instead?

    - metadata file (e.g. `nextstrain-workflow.yaml`) which acts to associate a
      source repo with an image and provide some other info for the packer
      (like entrypoint?).

  - Invoking packed workflows?
    - New command, e.g. `nextstrain run ncov`?
    - Or shoehorn into `nextstrain build`?
      - have to be able to disambiguate images from dirs, which gets tricky
      - and even then you have to change arg handling around a bit
      - and it won't be clear anymore from inspection what a given `nextstrain
        build` would do without knowing the context in which you ran it.
      - so I think new command not shoehorn
      - existing `nextstrain build` commands continue to work fine; don't need
        to switch to packs.  switch if you want the benefits of packs (no need
        to resolve any deps; no need to clone source repo; easy versioning).

    - maybe `nextstrain run` is an alias for `nextstrain workflow run`
    - and then `nextstrain workflow update ncov` is how you update whatever
      ncov version you're using?
      - or are workflow pack images not pinned like the `build` image?

    - New challenges compared to `build`
      - How to pass in extra files, e.g. profiles, config, data, etc, that
        _don't_ overlay the workflow source?
        - `nextstrain run ncov ~/projects/my-ncov/`?
        - How does workflow know where to look for this?  An env var?

      - Are workflow customizations supported?
        - Probably not beyond what the workflow lets you do via config/custom
          rules, etc.
        - If you need to modify the source of the workflow beyond that, you
          revert to using `nextstrain build`.
          - But `nextstrain build` can be smart and use the latest pack image
            as a starting point to override the default image?
          - Looks to metadata file for that.

  - Workflow names map to image names
    - Names
      - fully qualified
        - docker.io/nextstrain/ncov
        - ghcr.io/nextstrain/ncov

      - partially qualified
        - nextstrain/ncov → docker.io/nextstrain/ncov
        - should default elsewhere?
          - integration with GitHub would be much easier with ghcr.io

      - single-part (i.e. no slash)
        - ncov → nextstrain/ncov → docker.io/nextstrain/ncov

    - Tags
      - same as Docker
      - latest
