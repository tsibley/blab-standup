# or, reminding on my mind

The bot which reminds us to promote canary to production in a timely fashion
has been sending us double notifications, some time apart.

      Review the changes and promote (if appropriate) via the Heroku Dashboard.

      Changes are lingering on next.nextstrain.org.
      Review the changes and promote (if appropriate) via the Heroku Dashboard.

These correspond to the following GitHub Actions workflow runs:

  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/actions/runs/5605716109/job/15186858976>
  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/actions/runs/5608320463/job/15193697092>

Both of those runs produced this state:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "pipeline": "38f67fc7-d93c-40c6-a182-501da2f89d9d",
    "staging": "nextstrain-canary",
    "production": "nextstrain-server"
  },
  "staging": {
    "slug": "ae11b5d2-a798-489a-ada0-c86920e64ab9",
    "commit": "70c3b644d172898cf489113e77b6ac2510998a62",
    "releasedAt": "2023-07-14T22:03:29Z"
  },
  "production": {
    "slug": "8f5b7826-2502-45d1-bc48-30b865586377",
    "commit": "5b6808442908093f58bde9259916616a4abf1062"
  }
}
```

which hashes to:

    61d84dae9d18e7a88f726875037d7675b246b8a99a086f68a15cf24759c93476

The caching behaviour of the two runs was:

    restored from remind-to-promote-state-hash-5605206714
    stored to remind-to-promote-state-hash-5605716109

    restored from remind-to-promote-state-hash-5607826181
    stored to remind-to-promote-state-hash-5608320463

So why did it notify twice if the contents and hash hadn't changed?  Because of
the intervening runs meant the cached state _did_ change.  Notice that the
second run (obviously in hindsight) doesn't restore from the state stored by
the first run, but from the immediately prior run.  That run is:

  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/actions/runs/5607826181/job/15192288310>

It produced an empty state file (because `No one's around; skipping check.`)
hashing to:

    e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

And therein lies the issue.  The state is always chained from and compared to
the immediately prior run.  The double notification bug arises because we're
overloading the state's non-existence to mean both "nothing to promote" and
"something to promote, but not yet".
