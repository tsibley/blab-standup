Yet to do:

- [ ] Nextstrain CLI: removal of set up pathogens (and runtimes); `nextstrain teardown`?
- [ ] Nextstrain CLI: auto-cleanup of old pathogens after upgrade?
- [ ] Document what "compatible with `nextstrain run`" means
- [ ] nextstrain-pathogen.yaml schema
- [ ] Write up and document [design notes](2024-11-07.md)
- [ ] Lay down the way for pathogen documentation with an example or two
- [ ] Nextstrain CLI: commands for accessing version-specific pathogen docs? ([see also](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/407#issuecomment-2458212007), [see also](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/407#issuecomment-2472850864))
- [ ] Nextstrain CLI: `check-setup` support for pathogens?

- [ ] Nextstrain CLI: local source support in `nextstrain setup`, a la `pip install .` and `pip install --editable .` ([see also](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/407#issuecomment-2477528356), [see also](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/419#discussion_r1984007486))
