Many of our pathogen ingests avoid aligning the full set of sequences
(understandably), and our phylo runs typically subsample.  If we want to index
with LAPIS-SILO on more than unaligned sequences, then we'll need to do
pairwise, reference-based alignment on the full set of sequences separately.
We could save some compute and tailor each indexing process to re-use some
existing ingest-made alignments where possible, but it's probably easier to
have a generic indexing process that always aligns separately.  And we can
always tailor it per-repo to shave off compute later.

Some pathogens partition builds by species/subtypes.  We'll need to decide for
each if it makes sense to co-locate the species/subtypes in the same LAPIS-SILO
instance or separate instances.

- measles: Full alignment of N450 region only in ingest with Nextclade 3.  MAFFT for genomes, Nextclade 3 for N450 in phylo.
- mpox: Full alignment of genomes in ingest with Nextclade 2.  Nextclade 3 in phylo.
- seasonal-cov: No alignment in ingest.  Nextclade 3 in phylo.  Partitioned into 4 species.
- zika: No alignment in ingest.  MAFFT in phylo.
