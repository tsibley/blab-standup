- Make Nextstrain Groups
  - neherlab
  - for Louisiana?

- ~Catch up on email~

- `nextstrain update` handling when image is explicitly `nextstrain/base:latest`
  - See local wip
  - Need to adjust default so that it doesn't use "latest"; want people to be
    using stable `build-*` tags by default and have "track latest" be opt-in.

- Email current Groups users to let them know about discussion.nextstrain.org
- ~GitHub issue templates~
