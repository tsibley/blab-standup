# or, CRMs

Ways we interact with users:

  - hello@nextstrain.org
  - https://github.com/nextstrain issues and PRs
  - https://discussion.nextstrain.org
  - Office hours
    - Notes in Google Drive
  - Slacks
    - shared channels in Bedford Lab
    - SPHERES
    - STaPH-B
    - etc.

A holistic view of our interactions across team members is helpful for
maintaining shared context across the team.

Idea: Use Zoho Desk's CRM-like features (contacts = people + organizations) to
provide this holistic view.

Currently "customer" information in Zoho Desk is limited to the one support
channel we have enabled there: email to hello@nextstrain.org.

But we can create tickets from interactions that don't originate in email.  Or
create comments on the person record if we don't want stub tickets for these.

Custom fields on person records in Zoho Desk:

  - discussion.nextstrain.org email
  - GitHub username

Cross-linking to specific activity/events outside of Zoho Desk:

  - Match by email(s) for discussion.nextstrain.org
    - Primary email on person record
    - Custom field on person record for "discussion.nextstrain.org email"
      - Useful when the person uses different emails for the two systems

  - Match by username for GitHub
    - Custom field on person record for "GitHub username"
