# or, waiting around for builds on GitHub Actions

[Continuing](https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/compare/trs/pathogen-repo-build/wait-for-aws-batch-job)
my [untested WIP](https://gist.github.com/tsibley/258ab1b1e76f0bb32dbc3c17f892c169) ([c.f.](https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/pull/44#discussion_r1284721669)).

- Need to rejigger AWS credentialing.
- Stymied by lack of YAML anchor/reference support in GitHub Actions workflows.  Bummer!
- Stymied by testing in tsibley/github-actions-testing instead of a Nextstrain-owned repo, so `secrets: inherit` didn't work but is required.  Bummer!

Test (caller) workflow:

```yaml
name: Pathogen repo build

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  run-build:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    uses: nextstrain/.github/.github/workflows/pathogen-repo-build-exploded.yaml@trs/pathogen-repo-build/wait-for-aws-batch-job
    with:
      repo: nextstrain/zika-tutorial
      runtime: aws-batch
      run: nextstrain build --detach --env X=X .
    secrets: inherit
```

Next steps:

- Test in a Nextstrain-owned repo.  Which one?
- Set up a better workaround for lack of YAML anchors.  Currently manually expanding them with `yq`.  Ugh.
- Set up proper AWS role.
