# 9 July 2019

I'm going on continued paternity leave starting next week!  ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜…  I'll be
back Monday, August 5th.

## Big picture

[Summer 2019 design docs from early June](https://github.com/seattleflu/id3c/blob/master/dev/doc/design-2019-summer/01-overview.md).
Note that some priorities/goals have shifted a bit since then, but a good overall gist.

  - Replace fauna for Seattle Flu builds with ID3C (genomes in the database),
    which colocates the metadata and genomes and can avoid some data
    pushing/pulling
  - Return of results
  - "Current conditions"
  - [Modularize!](https://trello.com/c/BI2vAnOf/148-split-id3c-into-core-extension-architecture) but now or later?
  - [REDCap integration](https://github.com/seattleflu/id3c/blob/master/dev/doc/design-2019-summer/06-redcap.md), including data entry trigger + API endpoint
  - [FHIR ingestion](https://github.com/seattleflu/id3c/blob/master/dev/doc/design-2019-summer/04-fhir.md) from REDCap, Audere, and EHRs?

  - Load datasets from Nextstrain fauna into ID3C

## Todo this week before I leave

  - Production/deployment access for Jover and Kairsten
    - SSH keys for backoffice.seattleflu.org
    - AWS console access
      - IAM group with PowerUsers policy
      - IAM users
    - Pointers into [infrastructure doc](https://github.com/seattleflu/documentation/blob/master/infrastructure.md)

  - Code review and merge of longitudinal childcare ingestion
  - Code review and merge of self-test kit ingestion

  - Prioritize and schedule our Next Up tasks for my leave
  - Meet with team about my leave re: review and work items

  - Meet with team about Nextstrain scheduling
  - Meet with SFS data team

  - Fix schema owner issues, or at least describe the fix in a task

    1. Create new `id3c` role as db administrator/owner
    2. Reassign database and all objects within it to `id3c`.

       This can't use the nice `reassign owned` statement because our objects
       are owned by `postgres`.  So we have to use [something like
       this](https://github.com/MullinsLab/viroverse/blob/ee949dc2d36f7438f317747d0d668b7d902f3564/sql/sqitch-initial-setup.sql).

    3. Add `set role id3c` statements to the top of schema changes
       - Retroactively to existing changes
       - In the `schema/templates/` so its there by default

  - Get locations/places work to a good place and push it for review
