# or, Redis upgrade for nextstrain.org

[Notice from Heroku about required upgrade in the next couple months](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T032AT1ND-F04Q7QTUYN5/_nextstrain-server___action_required__version_approaching_end_of_life._upgrade_now__on_your_redis_add-on__redis_)

## The Plan

The [original plan]() did not survive contact with reality
([c.f.](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C01LCTT7JNN/p1679681991111399)).

 1. The first, albeit quickly surmountable, obstacle was that you can't detach
    the last attachment of an addon (at least without destroying the addon).
    So instead I double attached our existing Redis addon to the apps (as
    `OLD_REDIS`) and then removed the old attachment (as `REDIS`).

 2. The second, initially insurmountable, obstacle was that the fork/replica
    was stuck in "fork in progress" and wasn't syncing with the leader.  When I
    connected to it to check, I saw it was configured as a replica correctly
    but wasn't connected to the leader:

        $ heroku-redis-cli nextstrain-server/redis-closed-34498
        > info replication
        # Replication
        role:slave
        master_host:ec2-a-b-c-d.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        master_port:12345
        master_link_status:down
        master_last_io_seconds_ago:-1
        master_sync_in_progress:0
        slave_read_repl_offset:0
        slave_repl_offset:0
        master_link_down_since_seconds:-1
        slave_priority:100
        slave_read_only:1
        replica_announced:1
        connected_slaves:0
        master_failover_state:no-failover
        master_replid:9a3aa789101fe7d3e793b434d5826ec97d1dc56e
        master_replid2:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        master_repl_offset:0
        second_repl_offset:-1
        repl_backlog_active:0
        repl_backlog_size:1048576
        repl_backlog_first_byte_offset:0
        repl_backlog_histlen:0

    Trying to force a manual full sync failed:

        > sync
        Entering replica output mode...  (press Ctrl-C to quit)
        SYNC with master failed: -NOMASTERLINK Can't SYNC while not connected with my master

    Without access to Redis logs, it was unclear why.  I tried forking to a new
    addon again, thinking it might be a transient Heroku systems issue, but
    that didn't work.  I tried manually setting up replication, but realized I
    could use the `config set masterauth` or `replicaof` commands due to SaaS
    restrictions.  I eventually guessed it might have to do with connecting to
    the leader over TLS since it was using a self-signed (i.e. untrusted) cert,
    and bingo, forking with a non-TLS connection worked great.

After initial troubleshooting of (2) was not conclusive, I rolled back to our
previous state and went to lunch.  After lunch, I successfully troubleshooted
the forking/replica issue and completed the plan with modifications.  I've made
corresponding modifications below for future reference, but they don't
necessary reflect exactly what I did on-the-fly.

 0. Gather information.

        heroku redis:info redis-infinite-42947 -a nextstrain-server | tee redis-info
        heroku addons:info redis-infinite-42947 | tee redis-addon-info

 1. Disabling writes to Redis by changing its attachment from `REDIS` to
    `OLD_REDIS` on the apps:

        for app in nextstrain-{dev,canary,server}; do
            heroku addons:attach --as OLD_REDIS redis-infinite-42947 -a "$app"
            heroku addons:detach REDIS -a "$app"
        done

    Instead of entering maintenance mode for the whole site (as suggested by
    Heroku's docs), we'll instead put it into a slightly degraded state by
    removing (read/write) access to Redis.

    This won't affect access to public resources, but will affect anyone with
    an existing login session or establishing a new login session during the
    very brief switchover window:

      - Existing login sessions will be temporarily "forgotten".  They'll be
        "remembered" again after the upgrade.

      - New login sessions established during the upgrade will be permanently
        forgotten after the upgrade.  Anyone unfortunate enough to encounter
        this will need to log in again, although I expect it to affect
        approximately zero people.

    This tradeoff for the majority of the site staying up and available seems
    acceptable to me.

 2. Create the new, upgraded Redis instance as a fork (snapshot copy) of the old:

        heroku addons:create heroku-redis:premium-0 \
            --as NEW_REDIS \
            -a nextstrain-server \
            --fork "$(heroku config:get REDIS_URL -a nextstrain-server)"

 3. Wait for it to be ready:

        heroku addons:info redis-X-N

    Its `State` will change from `creating` to `created`.

    Check that the fork is done:

        heroku redis:info redis-X-N

    This starts at `fork in progress` and is supposed to change once completed
    (forks start as replicas and then switch to primaries), but it never seemed
    to complete for me.  All data looked transferred by inspection of `info
    keyspace`, a couple pages of `scan`, and a manually issued `sync` jumping
    over bulk sync and right to live monitor mode, so I moved on to promoting
    it.

 4. Compare settings to the previous instance and adjust as necessary:

        heroku redis:info redis-X-N | tee redis-new-info
        git diff redis{,-new}-info
        # make adjustments with other `heroku redis:â€¦` commands

    I only had to adjust `maxmemory` with:

        heroku redis:maxmemory redis-X-N -a nextstrain-server -p volatile-ttl

 5. Replace the old Redis instance with the new one:
 
        for app in nextstrain-{dev,canary,server}; do
            heroku redis:promote redis-X-N -a "$app" # attaches as REDIS
            heroku addons:detach NEW_REDIS -a "$app" # removes old NEW_REDIS attachment
        done

 6. Test that your login session is now "remembered" again.

 7. Remove the old Redis instance:

        heroku addons:detach OLD_REDIS -a nextstrain-dev
        heroku addons:detach OLD_REDIS -a nextstrain-canary
        heroku addons:destroy redis-infinite-42947
