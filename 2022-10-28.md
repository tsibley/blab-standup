# 28 October 2022
# or, some thoughts before I go

Soon:

- ~CLI: Update installation doc to include~
  - ~Automatic standalone installation~
  - ~Manual installation with~
    - ~pip~
    - ~pipx~
    - ~conda/mamba~

- ~CLI: runner â†’ runtime in docs and help~
- CLI: new Runtimes doc section (e.g. above/below Remotes)

- ~[Kick off group migration](https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/pull/137)~

- [Groups membership management API](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/pull/581)
  - dev/testing infra
  - new user signup story

- Plug-and-play automation for our pathogen builds
  - like what we do for ncov/ncov-ingest and monkeypox
  - done like how we do pathogen build CI

- Mount `NEXTSTRAIN_HOME` into Docker containers (shell, build, etc) and set
  the env var to the mounted path.  This allows the internal `nextstrain`
  command to share auth!  Maybe only mount part of it (just `secrets`)?

- [Goodbye, Gatsby!](2022-10-05.md)
  - <https://astro.build>?
  - something else?

Later?

- Narratives!

- [Content-Type weirdness](2022-09-19.md)

- [Buildpacks](2022-08-02.md) (and [also](2022-07-18.md#buildpacks))
  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/219#issuecomment-1405862129>
