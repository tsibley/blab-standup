## Loculus for Nextstrain pathogens

- 1:1 mapping of Nextstrain pathogen to Loculus organism

- Backend config per organism

- Ingest process per organism
  - Submits data from Nextstrain flat files to Loculus backend
  - New vs. existing records?

- Preprocessing pipeline
  - Minimal. We already "preprocessed" the data outside of Loculus!
  - Shared by all organisms, I hope
  - Adapts input to expected Loculus output?
  - Maybe does nothing but roundtripping the records?

- LAPIS (+ SILO)â€¦ not yet looked into but will need these services

- Generate organism config from flat files schema?
- Tear down and re-import from scratch daily or do incremental imports of new + modified records?

- Do we need Keycloak?  Can we use another (pre-existing) OIDC IdP instead?


### ðŸ‘€

- grep for `[[URL:` and see what's controllable to inject config? yikes.

- is that a committed credential I see? eek.
  nope, just a username.
