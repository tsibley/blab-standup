  - `GroupsSource extends PrivateS3Source` with `constructor(groupName)` so that
    `setSource("groups", req => req.params.groupName)` works.

    Make it use a single bucket, `nextstrain-groups`, which stores objects under
    `${groupName}/` prefixes.


  - Add additional authz method to `Source` classes for write
    (create/update/delete), something like `modifiableBy(user?)`.

    Or rename `visibleTo(user?)` and generalize to something like
    `source.authz("read" | "write" | "manage", user)`?
   
    Or maybe `readableBy(user?)`, `writableBy(user?)`, `manageableBy(user?)`?
