# or, frontend thoughts

My thoughts here boil down to trying to find a sweet spot of ideals:

  - Server-side dynamic rendering
  - Progressive enhancement of page components ("[partial hydration](https://ajcwebdev.com/2021/11/22/what-is-partial-hydration-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it/)", "[islands](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/)")
  - Ability to use React (or React-like Preact) given existing components and team knowledge
  - Fits into our existing server framework (this is big)
  - Elimination of framework bloat/scaffolding (we don't need it)
  - Elimination client-side routing ([unnecessary complexity](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextstrain-dot-org/en/latest/routing.html)), i.e. no SPA.
  - No or very minimal build/compilation step
    - No bundling (or splitting) step; use ESM imports client-side instead
    - Maybe an option for build-time static rendering for some pages

Our pages on nextstrain.org, excluding those delegated to Auspice, run the
gamut from mostly static and enumerable, e.g.:

  - Front page
  - Blog posts
  - Team page

to more dynamic and unenumerable, e.g.:

  - Overview pages for
    - Groups
    - Community on GitHub
  - Management pages for a Group (future)

I think this ends up suggesting:

  - [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) for JSX-like templates without a
    build step

  - React (or Preact) for page (i.e. template) components, with a focus on
    modular islands of interactivity not a single app

  - Dynamic rendering to HTML by the server

  - Partial (or "selective") hydration of islands with ???

The last point could be a smallish bit of custom code, or use an existing
library.  But I haven't found an existing library for that functionality that
doesn't assume it exists within a larger framework.  Implementing this
ourselves could take a variety of approaches, e.g. one approach would be using
React's
[`renderToPipeableStream()`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream)
on the server and
[`hydrateRoot()`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) on
the client, with a little custom bookkeeping passed between the two if we want
true "islands" rather than just full app hydration.


## Why not Next.js, Blitz, Astro, Capri, Gatsby, etc.?

[Next.js][], [Blitz][], [Astro][], [Capri][] ([Vite][]), [Gatsby][]

These frameworks all assume they're residing at the top-level of your app,
controlling the server-side routing, compilation/build stages, etc.

This is one reason, for example, why our current usage of Gatsby is so awkward:
it doesn't reside at the top-level, but both beneath and separate from our
bespoke server layer.

I don't think it's worth completely restructuring the app to adopt one of these
frameworks (but it could be reasonable to choose to do it anyway).

It's possible we could configure some of these to integrate their rendering and
features with our own server (e.g. [Next.js' custom
server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) support), but
this ends up looking a lot like our current Gatsby configuration.  Still, that
might be ok if we're much happier with Next.js (e.g.) over Gatsby.


## Why not Svelte, Vue, HTMX, Hyperscript, Marko, etc.?

[Svelte][], [Vue][], [HTMX][], [Hyperscript][], [Marko][]

These frameworks are all a departure from React.  Some would be good fits
otherwise, but it seems like the collective team knowledge around React
combined with our existing React components in nextstrain.org, Auspice,
Nextclade, etc. makes it worth sticking with React (or Preact).

I don't think it's worth ditching our experience with React to adopt one of
these frameworks (but it could be reasonable to choose to do it anyway).
