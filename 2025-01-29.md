### Questions

 1. Who retains access?  How?
 2. Is uninterrupted access needed?
 3. For Trevor: do you want to host this on AWS RDS or more bare bones?
    Potentially affects cost, performance, potential security certifications
    (e.g. HIPAA), etc.  Bare bones is my rec.
 4. Bonus: Can we restrict network access method with Tailscale (or another VPN)?
