# Nextstrain users/groups and sources/datasets

This is my (Thomas’) vision for users/groups and sources/datasets in Nextstrain
as improved through discussion and idea generation with Trevor, John, Jover,
Kairsten, and Misja on 6 September 2019.

It follows from a groundwork implementation I did ahead of Alli and James' trip
to the DRC to support private datasets and narratives on nextstrain.org for
[INRB](https://inrb.net).

## Names

What is described here is essentially a new Nextstrain "product", which I
think would be useful to consistently brand and promote.  We bandied about
several possible names:

* Nextstrain Hub (e.g. nextstrain.org/hub/inrb-drc)
* Nextstrain Nexus (nextstrain.org/nexus/inrb-drc)
* Nextstrain Clades (nextstrain.org/clade/inrb-drc)
* Nextstrain Teams (nextstrain.org/team/inrb-drc)
* Nextstrain Groups (nextstrain.org/group/inrb-drc)
* Nextstrain Organizations (nextstrain.org/organization/inrb-drc)

I'm a bit partial to Nextstrain Nexus because of the fun alliteration and play
on words with the [NEXUS file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file).

That said, Hubs are currently popular in computing (GitHub, Docker Hub, etc),
and I think Organization parallels well with our existing Community space.

In the rest of this document, I'll use Hub as a placeholder for the eventual
name.

## Concepts

* **User** — An individual account with a set of credentials.  Users are
  members of one or more groups.  Intended to be used by a single person but
  credentials may be shared in some cases (as INRB is currently doing, I
  believe).

* **Group** — A set of users (the members).  One or more members are owners of
  the group and may modify membership or visibility.  Groups may be public or
  private to the members.  Every group has a source.

* **Source** — A container for datasets and narratives.  Sources may be public
  or private to a group.  Every group has a source.  Some special sources will
  exist, like "live" (official/endorsed/blessed/etc), "staging", and
  "community".  The origin of files may be S3 buckets (e.g. nextstrain-data,
  nextstrain-inrb), GitHub repos (e.g. blab/zika-colombia), or other data
  stores.

* **Dataset** — A single tree + metadata, e.g. flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y.  This
  corresponds directly to a set of Auspice JSON files with a shared prefix
  (e.g. `flu_seasonal_h3n2_ha_2y`).

* **Narrative** — A single Markdown file containing Auspice's special narrative
  syntax.

* **Build** — A set of code and data (often in a git repo) used to produce
  datasets (often with augur), e.g.
  [nextstrain/seasonal-flu](https://github.com/nextstrain/seasonal-flu).

## Sign up

Currently, Nextstrain's limited users & groups are manually created and managed
by us (the admins).  There is no sign up form, although users can self-manage
their passwords once they're created.

**This state of things is very manageable for the first several potential
partners, like INRB, WA DOH, CDC-GISRS, etc.**  User creation is expected to be
part of an upfront, high-touch onboarding process with occasionally management
later.

The eventual sign up process is expected to create two or three things:

1. A new user
2. A new personal group for that user (with same name)
3. Optionally, a new shared team/org group with some desired name

Every user has a personal group which has a 1:1 association with a source.  The
user can add other users to their personal group if they so desire, or they can
remain the sole member.

A new shared group is optionally created if the user indicates, in response to
a sign up question, that they're planning to collaborate with
colleagues/coworkers.
