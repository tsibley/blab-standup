# or, EC2 "self"-hosted Linux arm64 runners for GitHub Actions

Rather than provisioning a specific, long-lived EC2 instance for this, I
imagine using GitHub Actions itself to launch and register instances on demand.
GitHub Actions supports ephemeral runners which deregister themselves and exit
(or maybe vice versa?) after some period of inactivity.  This seems perfect for
a workflow job which launches a new instance when necessary to handle a job and
lets the runner exit, deregister, and the instance terminate after some time.
This sort of system could use a pool where up to N new instances are launched
but after that the auto-launch is a no-op, or it could always launch a new
instance specifically for use by the current workflow run.

In terms of implementation, the workflow would look something like this
pseudo-code:

```yaml
jobs:
  launch-runner:
    id: launch-runner
    uses: nextstrain/.github/.github/workflow/launch-runner.yaml
    with:
      os: linux
      machine: arm64
    outputs:
      labels: ...

  build:
    needs: launch-runner
    runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(needs.launch-runner.outputs.labels) }}
    steps:
      - ...
```

The `labels` output would either be the bare minimum required by GitHub like
`["self-hosted", "linux", "ARM64"]` for a pool model or `["self-hosted",
"linux", "ARM64", "28e892c3-674b-4fc9-b7cb-813467d58a5c"]` for a
one-instance-per-workflow model.

The launch-runner shared workflow could also be a custom action.  Not sure
what's easier and a better fit.

It seems like [ephemeral runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners#using-ephemeral-runners-for-autoscaling)
are only assigned a single job, so they'd only be appropriate for the
one-instance-per-workflow model.

There are, of course, [other auto-scaling solutions out
there](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners),
but I wonder if they're good fits or not for our needs.  If they are, great!

Using the [webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_job)
mentioned there instead of launching explicitly in the workflow could be a
useful abstraction barrier, but it might also be harder to manage than the more
explicit coupling.  In particular, it means having another logging/monitoring system for the actions taken on receiving a webhook, when we could instead have that integrated into GitHub Actions.

As a sort of middle ground between webhooks and the approach described above,
we might be able to use [`workflow_run` events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run)
to accomplish a similar thing while staying within the GitHub Actions
ecosystem.
