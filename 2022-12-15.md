# or, CDC egress firewall issues

The CDC's egress firewall forces decryption (by MITMing connections),
presumably for "security" via content inspection.

We've typically dealt with consequences of that related to the trusted CA cert
store, e.g.:

  - https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/issues/774#issuecomment-963541619
  - https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/issues/726#issuecomment-1058342415

Recently, we've dealt with another consequence: OpenSSL 3.0.0 stopped
supporting unsafe TLS renego, which unfortunately is what CDC's egress firewall
does.

I believe this is either a compile-time option, or a runtime option for which
the plumbing doesn't exist to set from our very high level usage (e.g. via
requests â†’ urllib, or similar).  I don't think we can override it at runtime
via an environment variable (and if we could, I don't think it'd be a good
idea).

While our standalone Nextstrain CLI binaries don't use OpenSSL 3 (yet),
conda-forge upgraded a while back and so Conda installs are affected by the
issue.  This impacts Nextstrain CLI when installed via Conda (or Pip in Conda).
It may also impact our Conda runtime (and ambient runtimes with Conda) when
builds make requests to download input data files.  Our Docker runtime does not
use OpenSSL 3 (yet).
