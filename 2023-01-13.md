# or, A debugger for GitHub Actions

A few ways to think about this:

  - Manipulate the Runner agent (e.g. JobRunner and/or StepRunner classes)
    before/as/after things are run
    - Is this possible without ridiculous hacks like
      - in-memory modification of its data structures
      - bpf hooks

  - Manipulate the shell as it runs each step with `--debugger` or `extdebug`
    - Prior art
      - https://bashdb.sourceforge.net
      - https://github.com/ryakad/bashdb
      - others?
    - Something bespoke, less fully-fledged but more suited for Actions?
      - e.g. https://gist.github.com/tsibley/47c7694724fe86003a2ad778ebb585d9
    - Potentially enable for a job's subsequent steps by setting `BASH_ENV`?

  - Manipulate the workflow file to insert control points everywhere, hooked to
    by the debugger.
      - e.g. maybe the debugger is a workflow itself that:
        - takes as input another workflow path
        - locally downloads the containing repo of that workflow
        - adds hook points to the local copy
        - invokes the local copy

      - but this likely breaks when non-trivial context is needed by the
        workflow, because the call stack is "inside out"

  - Hook process start with eBPF, to "breakpoint" new job steps
    - Is this gnarly with eBPF?
    - Or very easy?

    - BCC
      - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md

  - Replace the shell with a wrapper that breakpoints at start/end
    - Easier than the DEBUG trap?

    - This can work, I've prototyped part of it.  A client/server design needed
      where the client is embedded in the shell wrapper and the server is
      connected to the developer's terminal.

    - Benefit of client/server design is the server could also sit off-host, or
      even be a web app.

    - But it's more work.
