# or, A debugger for GitHub Actions

A few ways to think about this:

  - Manipulate the Runner agent (e.g. JobRunner and/or StepRunner classes)
    before/as/after things are run
    - How possible is this without ridiculous hacks like in-memory modification
      of its data structures?

  - Manipulate the shell as it runs each step with `--debugger` or `extdebug`
    - Prior art
      - https://bashdb.sourceforge.net
      - https://github.com/ryakad/bashdb
      - others?
    - Something bespoke, less fully-fledged but more suited for Actions?
      - e.g. https://gist.github.com/tsibley/47c7694724fe86003a2ad778ebb585d9

  - Manipulate the workflow file to insert control points everywhere, hooked to
    by the debugger.
      - e.g. maybe the debugger is a workflow itself that:
        - takes as input another workflow path
        - locally downloads the containing repo of that workflow
        - adds hook points to the local copy
        - invokes the local copy

      - but this likely breaks when non-trivial context is needed by the
        workflow, because the call stack is "inside out"
