# or, Lab meeting ideas for the future

Today I'm going to give an update on Nextstrain Groups stuff, but I was
spitballing some other ideas which might be handy to remember in the future.

1. Talk about streaming data patterns, adapting my `recs` YAPC talk I gave a
   long time ago and connecting it to the current ncov-ingest pipeline and
   other contemporary approaches, like Dask.

2. Talk about some speculative stuff for how to support arbitrary dependencies
   for Nextstrain builds in the CLI (buildpacks, Conda).
