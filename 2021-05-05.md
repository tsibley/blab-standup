Without a lot of work upfront to Augur and all our builds, the user can't
escape having to know:

 1. A single conceptual "dataset" is represented by multiple files which have a
    common basename prefix

 2. How filenames map to website URLs

This is true if they're using the CLI to upload or an eventual web interface.

    nextstrain remote upload nextstrain.org/groups/blab auspice/*.json

Destination URLs for `nextstrain remote upload` commands are at the Group
level.  How are final website paths for uploaded datasets and narratives
determined?

below the base Group URL come from a combination of the basenames of the files being uploaded and any subpath solely from
the basenames of the files being uploaded?

XXX TODO: below needs 

    POST nextstrain.org/upload
      Bulk file upload for datasets and narratives

      Content-Type: multipart/form-data
      Content-Encoding: {gzip, deflate}

      Returns information on:
        - How files were grouped into datasets and narratives
        - Paths of those datasets and narratives
        - Files which couldn't be processed (unknown types, invalid names, etc)

      Provisional mode?
        - Files end up in temporary holding area
        - Upload batch id (a UUID) returned along with typical information above
        - Client can use upload batch id to make a second request to confirm or cancel the batch.
          - Confirming does the normal thing.
          - Cancelling removes the files.
        - Batch ids expire after a while.
