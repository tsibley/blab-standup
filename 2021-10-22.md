Tension between Nextstrain dev-side and science-side

Tension between exploring novel work and deepening impact of existing work

Vision is to have engineering side support R&D of science

Try to break down project silos in science, restructure how the science is done

Big consortia projects (SFS, forecasting coordination hub?, genepi center?) can
end up feeling like a second job, which is good for the consortia (aligns work,
goals, etc) but stressful for the people.  It can sap away all energy from
their "first" job (lab member, etc), as the priorities are competing.
