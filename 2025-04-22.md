Endpoints:

    /pathogen-repos/{name}/versions
        Accept: application/json

    /pathogen-repos/{name}/versions/{version}
        Accept: application/json
        Accept: application/zip

For example, `nextstrain setup measles` ends up requesting:

    /pathogen-repos/measles/versions
        Accept: application/json

to find latest version (first in response array), `main`, and then requests:

    /pathogen-repos/measles/versions/main
        Accept: application/zip

to get ZIP file of source (by way of redirecting to GitHub, most likely).

These two endpoints replace the CLI's current functions which make requests
against the GitHub API directly:

```python
def github_repo_latest_ref(repo_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Queries a GitHub *repo_name* to return the name of the highest version tag,
    if any, otherwise the name of the default branch.
    """
    ...

def github_repo_ref_zipball_url(repo: str, ref: str) -> URL:
    """
    Queries a GitHub *repo* to resolve *ref* (any commit-ish) to a specific
    commit id (SHA) and returns a URL to a ZIP file of the repo contents at
    that commit.
    """
    ...
```
