# or, authz and ACLs


## A

Principals have roles like

  ${name}/viewers
  ${name}/editors
  ${name}/owners

Objects have ACLs like

  Source
    ${name}/viewers → Read
    ${name}/editors → Read
    ${name}/owners  → Read, Write

  Resource
    ${name}/viewers → Read
    ${name}/editors → Read, Write
    ${name}/owners  → Read, Write

Authz function maps the two.


## B

Principals have roles like

  ${name}/viewers
  ${name}/editors
  ${name}/owners

Objects have tags like:

  ${name}             (Source class)
  ${name}/dataset     (Dataset class)
  ${name}/narrative   (Narrative class)

Security policy defines grants by (tag, role) tuples:

  (${name}, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
  (${name}, ${name}/editors, [Read])
  (${name}, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

  (${name}/dataset, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
  (${name}/dataset, ${name}/editors, [Read, Write])
  (${name}/dataset, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

  (${name}/narrative, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
  (${name}/narrative, ${name}/editors, [Read, Write])
  (${name}/narrative, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

Likely attached to Source objects for management purposes.

These are namespaced so that they can be considered globally...?

Do we need/care about cross-account access?


Tags and policy can be extended to specific objects!
