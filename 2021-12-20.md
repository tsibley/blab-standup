# or, authz, RBAC, and ACLs


## A

Principals have roles (groups) like

    ${name}/viewers
    ${name}/editors
    ${name}/owners

Objects have ACLs like

    PublicGroupSource & PrivateGroupSource
      ${name}/viewers → Read
      ${name}/editors → Read
      ${name}/owners  → Read, Write

    Group Resource
      ${name}/viewers → Read
      ${name}/editors → Read, Write
      ${name}/owners  → Read, Write

Authz function maps the two.

Can be non-Nextstrain Groups roles as well, like

    @core
    @admin

and other administrative groups we might want.  These could have ACLs attached as well (or not).

  CoreSource
    (public) → Read
    @core    → Read, Write


## B

Principals have roles like

    ${name}/viewers
    ${name}/editors
    ${name}/owners

Objects have tags like:

    ${name}             (Source class)
    ${name}/dataset     (Dataset class)
    ${name}/narrative   (Narrative class)

Security policy defines grants by (tag, role) tuples:

    (${name}, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
    (${name}, ${name}/editors, [Read])
    (${name}, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

    (${name}/dataset, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
    (${name}/dataset, ${name}/editors, [Read, Write])
    (${name}/dataset, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

    (${name}/narrative, ${name}/viewers, [Read])
    (${name}/narrative, ${name}/editors, [Read, Write])
    (${name}/narrative, ${name}/owners,  [Read, Write])

Likely attached to Source objects for management purposes.

These are namespaced so that they can be considered globally...?

Do we need/care about cross-account access?  Not now.


## A vs. B

Is there a meaningful difference between (A) security policies (tag, role,
grants) which are attached to/consulted from objects and (B) each object having
an ACL (role, grants) that's consulted?  Is the object tag conceptually
meaningful in the absence of a global security policy (unattached to objects)
or user-defined (as opposed to system-defined) tags and roles?

Pretty sure we should start with ACLs on objects (A) and can expand if
desired/needed in the future to generate those ACLs from a set of global and
per-Nextstrain Group security policies.

Note that either (A) or (B) can be extended to specific objects in the future,
e.g. for per-dataset ACLs.



## …

Currently we're focused on Nextstrain Groups here as the basic organizational
unit.  For example, there are a few teams which have both a public and private
group.

An alternative would be an Organization/Team record, which can own one or more
Groups.  But that's doesn't fit well with our namespacing expectations, and is a decent departure from our current model.

I think the things that would motivate that (mixes of public and private
datasets, different access within the Group/Team/Organization for different
pathogen builds) would also be satisfied by true RBAC ([of this
kind](https://tailscale.com/blog/rbac-like-it-was-meant-to-be/)) with arbitrary
per-object (dataset/narrative) tags, per-Group roles, and per-Group policy
rules set by Group owners, all expanded into an ACL our authz can work with.
