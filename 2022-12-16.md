# 16 December 2022
# or, CDC woes

[_continuing 15 Dec 2022_](2022-12-15.md)

centos 7
glibc 2.17
  too old to run standalone nextstrain cli (which has openssl 1.1.1)

openssl 1.1.1 in base conda env
openssl 3 in nextstrain conda env
  trying downgradeâ€¦
  it took forever for conda to solve, but worked!

this allowed `nextstrain` to connect, leaving just the CA issue to resolve

there was some trouble getting the CDC's CA certificate on the local machine
  but we got it to cdc-ca-cert.crt

CA issue was resolved once `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` was set

upload worked!
