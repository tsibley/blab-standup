# or, authz policies

No single authz policy for all of nextstrain.org, but different policies for
different parts of the site.  Right now, each Source has a policy.

Policies are enforced by authz.authorized() and co.

Actions are authz.actions.{Read,Write}.

Objects have authz tags.  Objects can inherit authz tags propagated from their container.

Policies describe how a given (object tag, user role) maps to permitted actions.



A group Source and Nextstrain Group are related but not synonymous concepts.
