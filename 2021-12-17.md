# or, Group names

_[Notes from a few weeks ago.  See also the group membership roles design doc.]_

group name requirements
    - case insensitive (but case preserving)
    - [a-z0-9-] to start but would really love full Unicode [\w] (key is to avoid slashes)
    - minimum length
        - 3?
    - maximum length
        - 40?
        - abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmn

        - what is Cognito max length?
            - leave room for our suffixes

    - forbidden wordlist?
        - after mangling, name can't match a block list of words
            - lower
            - s/[^a-z]//g
        - misleading words?
            - nextstrain
            - n3xtstrain
            - n3xtstr@in
        - offensives?
