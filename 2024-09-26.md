## Surfacing curated pathogen data

Conjure <https://nextstrain.org/sequences/measles> (for example) into existence.

- Index with [LAPIS-SILO][] as part of our pathogen ingest.  Store its
  "preprocessing" artifact in S3 (e.g. <s3://nextstrain-data/files/workflows/measles/lapis-silo-database.tar.zst>).

- Run a [LAPIS-SILO][] API instance that behind-the-scenes periodically pulls
  down the latest indexed data.

  This can maybe be a new Heroku app ("nextstrain-lapis") set to use the
  "container" stack, with the `ghcr.io/genspectrum/lapis-silo` image pushed to
  `registry.heroku.com/nextstrain-lapis/silo-api`?  Or not, there are 

- Run a [LAPIS][] instance pointed at the [LAPIS-SILO][] instance above.

  This can maybe be the `ghcr.io/genspectrum/lapis` image pushed to
  `registry.heroku.com/nextstrain-lapis/web`?

- Point an extracted search/browse page (client-side JS) from the [Loculus
  website][] at the [LAPIS][] instance.

- Serve search/browse page at <https://nextstrain.org/sequences/measles>.

### Heroku? Fly.io?

Heroku's [container
support](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime)
comes with lots of limitations, including one that's problematic for
LAPIS/SILO: no network links between containers/dynos.  This means we can't use
a single Heroku app for LAPIS with multiple process types (`web` for LAPIS,
`silo-api` for SILO).  We'd instead have to run/manage a separate Heroku app
for each instance, and thus expose them all to the public internet (or put them
on the same Tailscale network, but that's an extra layer of going against the
grain).  That's not a total nonstarter, but it's not ideal, and it'll mean a
long noisy slew of Heroku apps (2n, where n = number of pathogens).

Fly.io might be much better here, as it's a container-based platform that
shares a lot of the niceties of Heroku but not the limitations (e.g. persistent
volumes are available).  Downside of course is that the team is familiar with
Heroku but not Fly.io.
