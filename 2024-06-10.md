Diff-based thinking.  Get the computer to diff it for you.  Patches.  Applying
patches.  Diffs and patches for ~any format.

- Goals
  - teach you more about the diffs you already use
  - show you how to use diffs as patches
  - show you how to diff more things

  - If you find yourself carefully (and tediously) inspecting two things for
    changes with your ðŸ‘€, stop and consider a diff instead.

  - If you find yourself carefully (and tediously) re-applying changes by hand,
    stop and consider a patch instead.

- What's a diff?
  - different formats; unified is most common for exchange
  - Anatomy of a diff
  - file header
  - hunk header
  - context lines
  - removed lines
  - added lines

- What's a patch?
  - a diff written to a file
  - â€¦optionally with additional information, like from a git commit

- Duality
     --- a/â€¦
     +++ b/â€¦

     b - a = p
     a + p = b
     b - p = a

- When a format is diff-resistentâ€¦
  - â€¦convert it to text.
    - Git allows for this with textconv filters.
    - use examples from my ~/.gitconfig

  - â€¦use/write a specialized diff tool
    - Git allows for this with diff drivers
    - use examples from my ~/.gitconfig


## Examples

Metadata annotations are like patches

## Diffs and patches are central to Git

- Git tracks content, but displays changes between commits as diffs and patches.
  - aside: [darcs](https://darcs.net/DifferencesFromGit)
- Being more comfortable thinking in diffs/patches can be very helpful.
  - `git add --partial`
  - `git reset --partial`

## Tools

- `git diff` / `diff -u`
  - "unified diff"
  - different modes (side-by-side, for example)
  - diff a directory tree
  - can use outside of git repo too
  - how/when to ignore whitespace
  - `git diff` drivers and textconv

- `patch`
- `git am`
- `git format-patch`
- Adding `.patch` to GitHub commit/PR URLs or Gists
  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/333.patch>

- `git range-diff`
  - superior than GitHub's web version

- `git diff --color-moved`

  ```console
  git config --global diff.colorMoved blocks
  git config --global diff.colorMovedWS allow-indentation-change
  git config --global color.diff.newMoved "#0f18ec"  #  or: "blue"
  git config --global color.diff.oldMoved "#5283ff"  # and: "dim blue"
  ```

- `delta`

- `daff`
- `csv-diff`
- `deepdiff`
