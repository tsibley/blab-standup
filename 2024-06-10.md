Diff-based thinking.  Get the computer to diff it for you.  Patches.  Applying
patches.  Diffs and patches for ~any format.

## Diffs and patches are central to Git

- Git tracks content, but displays changes between commits as diffs and patches.
- Being more comfortable thinking in diffs/patches can be very helpful.
  - `git add --partial`
  - `git reset --partial`

## Tools

- `git diff` / `diff -u`
  - "unified diff"
  - different modes (side-by-side, for example)
  - diff a directory tree
  - can use outside of git repo too
  - how/when to ignore whitespace
  - `git diff` drivers and textconv
- `patch`
- `delta`
- `git range-diff`
  - superior than GitHub's web version
- `git diff --color-moved`

  ```console
  git config --global diff.colorMoved blocks
  git config --global diff.colorMovedWS allow-indentation-change
  git config --global color.diff.newMoved "#0f18ec"  #  or: "blue"
  git config --global color.diff.oldMoved "#5283ff"  # and: "dim blue"
  ```
