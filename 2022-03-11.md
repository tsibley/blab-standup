# 11 & 14 March 2022
# or, Nextstrain CLI packaging

any option will take some effort

- constructor may be simplest; downside is an install step instead of single file exe
- pyoxidizer is super promising but not quite turnkey
  - got it working!
  - nicely, it's faster than the original Python! (presumably because of module
    loading) so the CLI feels much snappier, which is cool.
- nuitka is interesting but seems less promising
- multi-platform pex + pyoxidizer would be very interesting indeed? or a rubbish idea?
  - leverage existing wheels for cross-platform compiling instead of letting pyoxidizer work its magic
  - I think rubbish.  Also annoying to scaffold the setup for embedding the PEX.
  - Start-up time is also still a bit slow since PEX must unzip/setup venv first.
