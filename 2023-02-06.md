# or, AWS

- Ensure all IAM users with admin-level access are split into
  - ${username}
  - ${username}-admin

  - Examples
    - trs (admin) + trs-no-admin (non-admin) would become trs (non-admin) + trs-admin (admin)
    - jover (admin) would become jover (non-admin) + jover-admin (admin)

- Encourage folks to use their non-admin accounts for daily driver
  - Make the usage of admin _explicit_

- Enforce MFA for API operations for admin users?

- New AWS account for testing & development
- AWS Organization to house both accounts?
