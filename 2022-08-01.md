# or, `nextstrain remote upload`'s use of filenames

_see also lots of my scattered notes on this over the past year (sigh), incl. [2021-08-17](2021-08-17.md)_


prefix? | n? | filename used?           | example                                                  | result
------- | -- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------
yes     | 1  | no  (prefix)             | groups/test/a/b + `x.json x_tip-frequencies.json`        | groups/test/a/b
yes     | 2+ | yes (prefix + filename)  | groups/test/a/b + `x.json x_tip-frequencies.json y.json` | groups/test/a/b/x groups/test/a/b/y
no      | 1  | yes (filename)           | groups/test + `x.json x_tip-frequencies.json`            | groups/test/x
no      | 2+ | yes (filename)           | groups/test + `x.json x_tip-frequencies.json y.json`     | groups/test/x groups/test/y


The first condition is "single" mode.


Things we might do (some mutually exclusive, some not):

1. Add an option to use the filename when only a single resource is specified
   with a prefix (i.e. overriding "single" mode), e.g.
   `--destination-from-filename` or something.

2. Default to always using the filename, even in what's currently "single"
   mode, and then provide an option to *not* use filenames, e.g.
   `--ignore-filenames`.  This option would be compatible only with "single"
   mode, and thus could even be called `--single`.

3. Default to never using the filename which effectively restricts the command
   to "single" mode, but then provide a `--multiple` or
   `--destination-from-filename` option to opt-into using the filenames and
   permit "multiple" mode.


2 and 3 are backwards incompat.

I think 2 is less friendly to basic usage, particularly for folks starting off.
However, it would also help with glob safety, as under `--single` if multiple
datasets are detected, an error would be thrown.  That said, we could implement
`--single` as an assertion option without changing the default behaviour.

1 is my preference, I think.
