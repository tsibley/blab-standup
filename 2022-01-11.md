  - download: Local path prefix for multiple datasets, not just directory
    
    If a single part path (i.e. no slashes) which doesn't exist, then treat as
    file basename prefix instead of missing directory.

    If a multi-part path which doesn't exist but where the parent path exists,
    then treat as a path + file basename prefix instead of a missing directory.
