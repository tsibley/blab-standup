    - live or nock or something else?

  - Multipart uploads?
    - Nope, not worth it, it turns out.  Wrote commentary in a commit.

  - Cloudfront invalidation?
    - Not needed while we're directly using S3 as our upstream for Groups.
    - Also given cost of invalidations and (I think) limits of number of them,
      this not something we should likely make a normal thing for most
      upload/delete ops.

  - download: Local path prefix for multiple datasets, not just directory
    
    If a single part path (i.e. no slashes) which doesn't exist, then treat as
    file basename prefix instead of missing directory.

    If a multi-part path which doesn't exist but where the parent path exists,
    then treat as a path + file basename prefix instead of a missing directory.
