# 5 April 2022
# or, this week's plans

_two week vacation starts after work friday_

- Release new CLI version
- [Groups migration docs](https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/pull/104)
- Collect info about Groups requestors/owners
- Canary debugging and deploy

- Migrate a few more groups and wait for issues to fall out.

  Wait for finishing docs, or at least preview build.
  
  1. neherlab (ask + link to docs)
  2. nextflu-private (coordinate with John? Jover? who else?)
  3. waphl (first external owners, but high touch in #nextstrain-wa-doh)

- Delay emailing Groups contacts until after I'm back from vacation.

- Add SOPs/policies re: Groups and roles to our wiki
  - Check groups and roles of the ticket requestor by email address (though yes, From is forgeable)
  - Respect role permissions when making updates
    - Customizations for migrated groups
    - Membership changes



## Cookie thing


- Existing nextstrain.org host-only cookie
- New nextstrain.org domain-wide cookie

Conflict in name.  No good way to clear the host-only cookie, because we don't
know the Expires value.  Easiest thing to do is to switch to a new name and
opportunistically migrate the old cookie to the new name when appropriate.

### Testing

in a private browsing mode to avoid existing cookies
  alternatively:
    clear all cookies for dev.nextstrain.org
    clear all cookies for canary.nextstrain.org

deploy master to dev.nextstrain.org
establish session with dev.nextstrain.org using old cookie name

deploy trs/canary to dev.nextstrain.org and canary.nextstrain.org
visit dev.nextstrain.org
ensure cookie is migrated to new name
ensure session is portable to canary.nextstrain.org

old cookie will naturally expire after 30 days since it will no longer be
reset on each request
