# 5 April 2022
# or, this week's plans

_two week vacation starts after work friday_

- Groups migration docs
- Collect info about Groups requestors/owners
- Canary merge

- Migrate a few more groups and wait for issues to fall out.
  
  Wait for finishing docs, or at least preview build.
  
  1. neherlab (ask + link to docs)
  2. nextflu-private (coordinate with John? Jover? who else?)
  3. waphl (first external owners, but high touch in #nextstrain-wa-doh)
