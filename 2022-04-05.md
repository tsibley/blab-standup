# 5 April 2022
# or, this week's plans

_two week vacation starts after work friday_

- [Groups migration docs](https://github.com/nextstrain/docs.nextstrain.org/pull/104)
- Collect info about Groups requestors/owners
- Canary debugging and deploy

- Migrate a few more groups and wait for issues to fall out.
  
  Wait for finishing docs, or at least preview build.
  
  1. neherlab (ask + link to docs)
  2. nextflu-private (coordinate with John? Jover? who else?)
  3. waphl (first external owners, but high touch in #nextstrain-wa-doh)

- Delay emailing Groups contacts until after I'm back from vacation.
