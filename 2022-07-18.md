- `nextstrain remote download` and `upload` behaviour tweaks

  - remote upload: when to use local filename and when to not
  - remote download: include more of URL in the local filename
  - remote download: Local path prefix for multiple datasets, not just directory
    
    If a single part path (i.e. no slashes) which doesn't exist, then treat as
    file basename prefix instead of missing directory.

    If a multi-part path which doesn't exist but where the parent path exists,
    then treat as a path + file basename prefix instead of a missing directory.

  - [`--prompt` and `--dry-run` modes](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/149)

- Groups customizations
  - https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/51
  - Write up CLI commands issue

        nextstrain group {name} logo get
        nextstrain group {name} logo set {filename}
        nextstrain group {name} overview get
        nextstrain group {name} overview set {filename}

        nextstrain remote upload groups/{name} group-overview.md
        nextstrain remote upload groups/{name} group-logo.png

  - Write up web UI issue?
  - Update "sourceInfo" to point to these URLs instead of fetching/embedding?


- Timeline for sending out migration emails?
  - Review https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html#notification

- Groups member management
  - API
    - List roles
      GET /groups/:groupName/~/roles

    - List members of role (memberships)
      GET /groups/:groupName/~/roles/:roleName/members

    - Get member of a role (membership)
      GET /groups/:groupName/~/roles/:roleName/members/:username
        returns metadata about this _membership_, e.g. metadata like
        "created_at" or similar, or who added the user to the role.  don't
        know if we have that metadata, so may be sparse for now, but still a
        useful endpoint for existence.

    - Add member to role (results in new member or adding role to existing member)
      PUT /groups/:groupName/~/roles/:roleName/members/:username

    - Remove member from a role
      DELETE /groups/:groupName/~/roles/:roleName/members/:username
  - CLI? maybe not, but users need some way of interacting?

## Internalish stuff

- PUT/DELETE support for core and staging
  - Invalidations are sidestepped because the server no longer goes thru CloudFront
  - Authz policy could use internal Cognito group, e.g. `@core`

- Audit use of Cache-Control
  - nextstrain.org endpoints
    - Add cache control headers at source routing level.
    - All pages get private, no-cache (max-age=0, must-revalidate).
  - S3 object metadata
    - Set on upload via nextstrain.org.
  - Cloudfront distribution configuration
    - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>
    - Fix cloudfront for data.nextstrain.org
    - Use long min TTL since we use invalidations anyway!??


## Buildpacks

- How to make images
- How to run them
  - Single build dir now becomes image + extra files dir (like with ncov +
    profiles or Terra/WDL)
- Good update story for software + pipeline + data, etc. with nextstrain
  update.

- `nextstrain pack` (name is meh!)
  - `pack build`: makes an image (similar to docker build)
  - `pack publish`: publish image (similar to docker push)

  - maybe `nextstrain workflow pack` and `publish` or something instead?

  - metadata file (e.g. `nextstrain-workflow.yaml`) which acts to associate a
    source repo with an image and provide some other info for the packer
    (like entrypoint?).

- Invoking packed workflows?
  - New command, e.g. `nextstrain run ncov`?
  - Or shoehorn into `nextstrain build`?
    - have to be able to disambiguate images from dirs, which gets tricky
    - and even then you have to change arg handling around a bit
    - and it won't be clear anymore from inspection what a given `nextstrain
      build` would do without knowing the context in which you ran it.
    - so I think new command not shoehorn
    - existing `nextstrain build` commands continue to work fine; don't need
      to switch to packs.  switch if you want the benefits of packs (no need
      to resolve any deps; no need to clone source repo; easy versioning).

  - maybe `nextstrain run` is an alias for `nextstrain workflow run`
  - and then `nextstrain workflow update ncov` is how you update whatever
    ncov version you're using?
    - or are workflow pack images not pinned like the `build` image?

  - New challenges compared to `build`
    - How to pass in extra files, e.g. profiles, config, data, etc, that
      _don't_ overlay the workflow source?
      - `nextstrain run ncov ~/projects/my-ncov/`?
      - How does workflow know where to look for this?  An env var?

    - Are workflow customizations supported?
      - Probably not beyond what the workflow lets you do via config/custom
        rules, etc.
      - If you need to modify the source of the workflow beyond that, you
        revert to using `nextstrain build`.
        - But `nextstrain build` can be smart and use the latest pack image
          as a starting point to override the default image?
        - Looks to metadata file for that.

- Workflow names map to image names
  - Names
    - fully qualified
      - docker.io/nextstrain/ncov
      - ghcr.io/nextstrain/ncov

    - partially qualified
      - nextstrain/ncov → docker.io/nextstrain/ncov
      - should default elsewhere?
        - integration with GitHub would be much easier with ghcr.io

    - single-part (i.e. no slash)
      - ncov → nextstrain/ncov → docker.io/nextstrain/ncov

  - Tags
    - same as Docker
    - latest
    - sha256@abadcafe…
