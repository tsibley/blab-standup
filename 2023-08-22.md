# or, GitHub Actions and AWS Batch pathogen builds

We want to [stay attached](https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/pull/44#discussion_r1214646489)
to pathogen builds running on AWS Batch launched by GitHub Actions workflows.
This lets our launching stay close to the source of the build and events that
triggered it while not creating a confusing disconnect between the outcome of
the GitHub Actions workflow run and the AWS Batch job.

**I think this is important, and we should stop dragging our feet and make it
feasible one way or another.**

However, staying attached so requires long-lived GitHub Actions jobs which
would bump us into job concurrency limits pretty quickly impacting pathogen
builds and other normal CI jobs.  We need to avoid those, either thru
**self-hosted runners** or **a GitHub plan upgrade**.

Note that none of this really relates to self-hosting runners for access to
macOS on arm64 hardware.  We still want access to macOS on arm64, and maybe
also access to more than 5 concurrent macOS jobs on GitHub-hosted runners.


## Self-hosted runners

We'd run the GitHub Actions jobs that launch and stay attached to the AWS Batch
builds on our own self-hosted runners.  This avoids the job concurrency limit
(currently 20) for GitHub-hosted runners and also lets us set a longer job
timeout (e.g. more than 6 hours) so we don't have to do job chaining (see
below).  Those are both real nice!

[My previous notes on autoscaling self-hosted runners on EC2](2022-09-14.md)
noodled on an idea of a simpler, less bells-and-whistles approach to
autoscaling on EC2 where the control plane (orchestration layer) remains all
within GitHub Actions… but it probably doesn't make sense to build this out
ourselves.

We should just use [philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner](https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner).
Its AWS Lambda-based (i.e. scale-to-zero) control plane and support for
ephemeral runners of makes it appealing.

This will incur "double billing", i.e. we'll be paying for the GitHub Actions
runner EC2 host that's attached to the build and paying for the AWS
Batch-managed EC2 host that's running the build.  But it should be minimal,
esp. as we can use small EC2 Spot instances for the runner hosts.

### How to do it

- Establish an AWS Organization as a container for AWS accounts
- Separate AWS account for this infra as a hard security boundary
- Deploy the Philips Terraform module from a new nextstrain/infra repo or
  similar, where we'd house other things like our own Terraform modules for
  defining
  [AWS IAM roles assumed by GitHub Actions jobs via OIDC](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/22#issuecomment-1588211457)
- Ephemeral runners only (c.f. [considerations for Philips Labs approach](https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner#ephemeral-runners))
- Pay attention to security considerations

## GitHub plan upgrade

Instead of operating our own self-hosted runner infra—even if it's
"off-the-shelf" it'll take time and attention and money—we could instead
upgrade the Nextstrain organization on GitHub
to the ["Team" plan](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-team).
This would give us [60 concurrent jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits)
(up from 20 now), which I think would be more than enough.

The upside is this would be a _lot_ simpler and use much less of our time and
attention.  We'd regain the complexity of job chaining to support builds that
take longer than 6 hours, but I've shown that's doable (see below) and it'd be
encapsulated complexity.

The downside is it'd be relatively expensive price-wise (but again, not time-
and attention-wise).  This is
[billed per-user](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/about-per-user-pricing#people-that-consume-a-license)
at $4/month/user.  Currently we have ~70 users in our GitHub org.  While that
number could likely be pruned significantly (e.g. we could likely remove the entire
["translators" team](https://github.com/orgs/nextstrain/teams/translators)),
we'd still probably settle in around ~30 users or ~$1,440 per year.  My sense
is this is more than we'd spend on self-hosted runners, but I haven't done the
math, and that's not factoring into account our time and attention.

### How we'd do it

- Prune organization members
- Click the buttons to upgrade to the "Team" plan
- Work around the 6 hour job timeout that GitHub enforces
