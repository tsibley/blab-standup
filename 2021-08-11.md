* Zen Desk for hello@nextstrain.org?

* API and CLI for upload (and how it relates to download interfaces)

  - User specifies the URL they want; filename doesn't matter (except maybe for
    sidecar identification; see below).

  - Server stores files with the necessary names, but this is an internal
    implementation detail and something a Groups user doesn't need to worry
    about.  They just specify where they want the dataset or narrative to
    appear.

  - Sidecars identified by one of or some combination of:
    - Filename suffixes (`_tip-frequencies`, `_root-sequence`, etc)
    - Content inspection (contains expected keys for a given sidecar type; not full validation)
    - Schema validation

  - Clients (e.g. the CLI) can easily upload a single dataset (multiple local
    files) at a time.  Optionally, multiple datasets could be supported by
    enabling client-side grouping of local files by common prefix and doing
    filename → desired URL transformation.  Contrary to previous thinking, this
    responsibility of handling filenames seems best left with the clients, as
    clients have direct interaction with the user and can provide options or
    interactive prompts to nail down the user's intent.

  - By decoupling local filenames from the determination of nextstrain.org URL,
    the ability of downloaded files to round-trip no longer matters as much.
