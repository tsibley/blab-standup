* Zen Desk for hello@nextstrain.org?

* API and CLI for upload (and how it relates to download interfaces)

  - User specifies the URL they want; JSON/Markdown filenames don't matter
    (except maybe for sidecar identification; see below).

  - Server stores files on the backend (S3) with the necessary names, but this
    is an internal implementation detail and something a Groups user doesn't
    need to worry about.  They just specify where they want the dataset or
    narrative to appear.

  - Sidecars are identified client-side by one of or some combination of:
    - Filename suffixes (`_tip-frequencies`, `_root-sequence`, etc)
    - Content inspection (contains expected keys for a given sidecar type; not full validation)
    - Schema validation

  - Clients (e.g. the CLI or even curl) can upload a single dataset with
    multiple PUTs of individual files:

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -T auspice/foo.json

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name?root-sequence \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -T auspice/foo_root-sequence.json

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name?tip-frequencies \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -T auspice/foo_tip-frequencies.json

    or maybe

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.main+json' \
          -T auspice/foo.json

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.root-sequence+json' \
          -T auspice/foo_root-sequence.json

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.nextstrain.v2.tip-frequencies+json' \
          -T auspice/foo_tip-frequencies.json

    (These same endpoints would support GET and DELETE requests.)

    or with a single POST of multiple files:

        curl https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/some/name \
          -F main=@auspice/foo.json \
          -F root-sequence=@auspice/foo_root-sequence.json \
          -F tip-frequencies=@auspice/foo_tip-frequencies.json

  - Clients can support upload of multiple datasets by organizing local files
    by their common prefix and doing the conventional filename → desired URL
    transformation.

    Contrary to some [previous](2021-05-05.md)
    [thinking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VUJfaMfcw1z4KqQ-lD2-ppI1_OMDwLApuygKU7IrBNk/edit#slide=id.gd6151378c0_0_23),
    this responsibility of handling filenames seems best left with the clients,
    as clients have direct interaction with the user and can better provide
    options or interactive prompts to nail down the user's intent.

  - By decoupling local filenames from the determination of nextstrain.org URL,
    the [ability of downloaded files](2021-08-09.md) to round-trip no longer
    matters as much.
