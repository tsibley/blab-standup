# or, AWS IAM users: admin vs. user

Split internal IAM users for team members into "normal" user accounts and
"admin" user accounts:

  - ${name}
  - ${name}-admin

Ivan and I currently have the inverse for Hysterical Raisins, e.g.:

  - trs-no-admin
  - trs

Permissions needed, using managed roles if possible:

  - Cognito (power user role)
  - S3 to sensitive buckets (e.g. incl. `nextstrain-groups`)
