# or, Pathogen repos and `nextstrain build`

_[posted as a comment](https://github.com/nextstrain/pathogen-repo-template/pull/16#issuecomment-1911079700) to "[workflows: Add hardcoded `workdir` directives](https://github.com/nextstrain/pathogen-repo-template/pull/16)"_

I think standardizing on `workdir: workflow.current_basedir` in our workflows
makes sense and is a good idea.  It makes paths within the workflow much more
predictable: they're always relative to the `Snakefile` unless you override the
workdir (e.g. with `--directory` or `-d`).  This inverts the default Snakemake
behaviour of paths in the workflow being relative to whatever the working
directory is when `snakemake` is invoked, which I've long thought was confusing
and backwards.  Still, with the `workdir:` proposal here, that default
behaviour may be regained if needed by passing `--directory .` when invoking
workflows from outside their containing directory.

That said, I have a separate proposal for addressing the `nextstrain build` UI
issues.  Or, at least, how to address them further so that even `-s` isn't
necessary and specifying files as targets
(`results/hmpxv1/good_sequences.fasta`) doesn't feel as "odd".

The proposal by example:

```console
$ tree mpox/
mpox/
├── nextstrain-pathogen.yaml
├── ingest/
│   ├── Snakefile
│   └── …
├── phylogenetic/
│   ├── Snakefile
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── hmpxv1/
│   │   │   ├── config.yaml
│   │   │   └── …
│   │   └── …
│   ├── results/
│   │   ├── hmpxv1/
│   │   │   ├── good_sequences.fasta
│   │   │   └── …

└── …

$ cat nextstrain-pathogen.yaml
---
name: mpox
url: https://github.com/nextstrain/mpox

  - name: the Nextstrain team
    url: https://nextstrain.org

$ nextstrain build mpox/ingest
$ nextstrain build mpox/phylogenetic
$ nextstrain build mpox/phylogenetic \
>   --configfile config/hmpxv1/config.yaml

$ nextstrain build mpox/phylogenetic \
>   results/hmpxv1/good_sequences.fasta \
>   --configfile config/hmpxv1/config.yaml

$ cd mpox/phylogenetic
$ nextstrain build . \
>   --configfile config/hmpxv1/config.yaml

$ nextstrain build . \
>   results/hmpxv1/good_sequences.fasta \
>   --configfile config/hmpxv1/config.yaml

$ snakemake --cores all \
>   results/hmpxv1/good_sequences.fasta \
>   --configfile config/hmpxv1/config.yaml
```

How would this work?  By detecting and drawing the filesystem isolation
boundary at the pathogen repo root instead of at the working directory given to
`nextstrain build`.  That is, making the filesystem isolation boundary (i.e.
what's mapped to `/nextstrain/build` in a container) _a separate thing_ from
the workflow and starting working directory (i.e. what's given to `nextstrain
build`).

The pathogen repo root is indicated by the presence of
`nextstrain-pathogen.yaml`, which we can then later leverage to also contain
pathogen-level metadata for use elsewhere in indexing, listing, attribution,
etc.  An empty file would work just fine for now for the purposes of this
proposal; the important bit is having a marker file (and one not tied to Git,
i.e. `.git/` is not a good substitute).

What does this look like in a container in practice?

```console
$ nextstrain shell --docker mpox/phylogenetic
Entering the Nextstrain runtime (docker)

Mapped volumes:
  /nextstrain/build is from /home/tom/nextstrain/mpox

Run the command "exit" to leave the runtime.

$ pwd
/nextstrain/build/phylogenetic

$ tree
/nextstrain/build/phylogenetic/
├── Snakefile
├── config/
│   ├── hmpxv1/
│   │   ├── config.yaml
│   │   └── …
│   └── …
├── results/
│   ├── hmpxv1/
│   │   ├── good_sequences.fasta
│   │   └── …
│   └── …
└── …

$ cd ..
$ tree -L 1
/nextstrain/build/
├── nextstrain-pathogen.yaml
├── ingest/
├── phylogenetic/
├── nextclade/
├── shared/
└── …
```

The core ideas in this proposal have stewed for years now—typically as part of
my "workflows as programs" thinking—and while the iron's been warm previously,
it now seems like—for this specific UI-focused change—the iron is hot and it's
time to strike.

<p align=center>⁂</p>

As a final thought: the tangle thru which we're trying to find the clearest
path here arises solely, I believe, from the desire to have files shared
between our various workflows (e.g. the workflows in `ingest/` and
`phylogenetic/` reference `shared/`).  If we ditched the premise that they
could access them directly, the whole tangle would go away, right?  We could
still maintain `shared/` but as part of the dev process ensure they're copied
into the places in `ingest/` and `phylogenetic/` as needed (e.g. by running
`make` or `./devel/proliferate-shared` or similar and enforcing so with
CI/linting).

I'm not saying we _want_ to do this… but it doesn't seem _terrible_ and I'm
not sure we've seriously considered it?
