      - Before
        - Ask us to migrate your group
        - Tell us who owners, editors, viewers should be
        - Pick a datetime (or leave it up to us)
        - Upgrade nextstrain-cli in advance (ideally)
      - After
        - Test it out
        - Use new commands going forward
        - Email us with role changes (for now)

  - Collect "owners"

  - Migrate Cognito groups
    - create new Cognito groups
    - add existing users to appropriate Cognito groups
    - remove old Cognito groups

    - do not remove transition period logic in authn as it will still affect
      sessions with the old groups

  - Tool to perform migration for a group
    - copy data
    - update data/groups.json to remove bucket key

    - remove public access policy on old bucket
    - leave old bucket in place for X months
