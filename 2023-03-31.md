"custom microframework"

"scaffolding"

- sort out client-only components
  - throw a client-only error so they don't get server-rendered and instead get
    retried client-side

  - hydrate them automatically, e.g. in sendPage()

  - serve their source


## Next.js

Can we move all server-side routes and frontend routes into Next.js with the
"App Router" beta feature in v13?

- intriguing and tantalizing
  - server-focused development, with ability to sprinkle in client-side
    pages/components as needed
  - great DX

- port of API endpoints should be doable
  - but impossible to serve a page (HTML) to the browser on some GETs and also
    respond to other methods with an API handler; maybe can workaround with
    multiple routes and internal rewriting?

- port of middleware will be difficult
  - there can be only one
  - that one can only be global, so must do its own route matching if necessary
  - ~middleware can't send a response, so can't do authz~ as of v13 it now can
  - (is it really middleware as commonly known at that point? not really…)


Can we leave existing server-side routes as-is but tightly integrate it for
frontend pages?
