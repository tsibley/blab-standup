# or, Re: `trs/groups-members-api`

Currently this branch is missing a good, safe solution for dev and testing of these API endpoints.  I really don't want to grant all dev/test instances (local, GitHub Actions, Heroku review apps, etc) permissions to modify all groups, but AWS IAM policies don't support a finer resource specificity than the user pool, so we can't use the same approach we do with S3 buckets and prefix-scoping.  Given these conflicting constraints, a separate dev-only user pool seems most appropriate, but that's a bit more initial work to setup and more ongoing work to manage/keep relevant over time.  I'm a little loathe to address that now or as a prerequisite for this work, but I also don't like not having a dev/testing story here.  We're rapidly reaching (or are at?) the point where I really want separate dev vs. prod AWS accounts controlled by Terraform or CloudFormation something.

Before merge:

- [ ] Drop `drop! local testing only` commit

- [ ] Sync IAM policies (dry run first as below, then add `--wet-run`):

  ```
  envd aws/blab/trs -- parallel -v './scripts/sync-iam-policy arn:aws:iam::$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/{/.} {}' ::: aws/iam/policy/*.json
  ```
