Goal: Use same build in CI for both testing and deploy to Heroku.

So how to do this?

Our options boil down to:

  1. Build on Heroku, then download to GitHub Actions for testing, then deploy from Heroku
  2. Build on GitHub Actions, test, and then upload slug to Heroku for deploy

Option 1 is slow—both the build itself and the downloading of the resulting
slug—but means that the Heroku build process (buildpacks, stacks, etc.) remains
entirely owned and managed by Heroku.

Option 2 is fast—GH Actions runners are much faster than Heroku build dynos—but
it pulls aside the curtain a bit on how Heroku works and takes some of it into
our own hands.  Less magical maybe, but greater understanding of how things
actually work (and that seems useful for deploy infra).

Option 2 seems nicer to me.  It gives us precise control of the build/deploy
process and sets us up better for future deploy improvements (or even someday
moving off Heroku).  It's more involved than what we do now, but the machinery
is pretty straightforward.

It starts with building the app using the Heroku Node.js buildpack and packing
the result into an archive:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org app

mkdir build
git clone https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs build/pack
mkdir build/cache # or, restore cache from previous build.
mkdir build/env   # *not* config vars/env

export STACK=heroku-20
export SOURCE_VERSION="$(git -C app describe --always)"
export SOURCE_DESCRIPTION="$(git -C app log -1 --format=%s)"

docker run \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm --interactive --tty \
  -v "$(realpath app)":/app:rw \
  -v "$(realpath build/pack)":/build/pack:ro \
  -v "$(realpath build/cache)":/build/cache:rw \
  -v "$(realpath build/env)":/build/env:ro \
  -e STACK \
  -e SOURCE_VERSION \
  heroku/heroku:20-build bash -c '
       /build/pack/bin/detect  /app
    && /build/pack/bin/compile /app /build/cache /build/env
    && /build/pack/bin/release /app
  '

# <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-deploying-slugs>
tar czvf slug.tar.gz app/
```

Then we create the slug on Heroku:

```
export SLUG_CHECKSUM="SHA256:$(sha256sum slug.tar.gz | awk '{print $1}')"

export PROCS="$(
  jq --slurp --raw-input '
      split("\n")
    | map(capture("^[[:space:]]*(?<key>[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+):?\\s+(?<value>.*)[[:space:]]*")) # <https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-procfile/blob/df64135f/src/procfile.rs#L42-L44>
    | from_entries
  ' < app/Procfile
)"

jq --null-input '{
  "stack": env.STACK,
  "checksum": env.SLUG_CHECKSUM,
  "commit": env.SOURCE_VERSION,
  "commit_description": env.SOURCE_DESCRIPTION,
  "process_types": (env.PROCS | fromjson),
}' | tee slug-create.json

# <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#slug-create>
curl https://api.heroku.com/apps/nextstrain-canary/slugs \
  --data-binary @slug-create.json \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3' \
  --fail --silent --show-error --location --netrc \
    | tee slug.json

curl "$(jq -r .blob.url slug.json)" \
  --request "$(jq -r .blob.method slug.json)" \
  --data-binary @slug.tar.gz \
  --fail --silent --show-error --location --netrc
```

With the slug uploaded, deploying it to an app is another API call:

```bash
# <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#release-create>
curl https://api.heroku.com/apps/nextstrain-canary/releases \
  --data-binary @<(jq '{slug: .id}' slug.json) \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3' \
  --fail --silent --show-error --location --netrc \
    | tee release.json
```
