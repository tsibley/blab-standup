# or, Cognito user pool changes

There's a slowly-accumulating pile of changes I'd like to make to our
nextstrain.org Cognito user pool which will require making a _new_ user pool
and _migrating_ existing users upon login (seamlessly).

## Changes

- Switch usernames (and other sign in aliases like email addresses and
  preferred usernames) to be **case-insensitive**

- Remove unneeded custom attribute `allowed_sources`

- Sign in with email address instead of username?  Requires considering how we
  avoid disclosing email address in the nextstrain.org UI.  Code would use
  `sub` id, but humans want something meaningful.  Currently that's username,
  but could be email address in non-public context.

- Allow sign in with preferred username even if using email instead of
  username? Can we do this?  Seems [like it][1]:

  > You can mark the email address, phone number, and preferred username
  > attributes as aliases.

## Migration

Requires an AWS Lambda function to do the actual work to migrate each user.

The function is called by the _new_ user pool when a login attempt fails
because the user doesn't exist.  The function is responsible for attempting
login against the _old_ user pool and, if successful, migrating the user to the
new pool and returning success to log them in there.

There are AWS docs and an example for this.  We'll want to use that as a
starting point, probably, and manage it all (new user pool, Lambda function,
etc.) with Terraform.
