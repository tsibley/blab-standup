## Workflows as programs design notes/principles

- `nextstrain build` continues to work. `nextstrain run` and related
  workflow-level changes are higher-level wrappings around that (conceptually,
  if not in actuality).

- Compatibility with `nextstrain run` can be positively-asserted by a field in
  `nextstrain-pathogen.yaml`.  This field should be a major version which lets
  us assert on other changes in the future too.

- Workflows within a pathogen repo could be discovered by inspecting filesystem
  contents.  Or, alternatively, we could require their declaration in
  `nextstrain-pathogen.yaml`.

- [No magic in workflows.](https://github.com/nextstrain/public/issues/1#issuecomment-2463068756)

- No passthru of arguments to Snakemake à la `nextstrain build`.  Instead,
  recapitulate or bundle/wrap options we want to expose.

- Use `workflow.basedir` or `workflow.current_basedir`; avoid
  `workflow.source_path(…)` (it has [issues](2024-10-23.md)).

  These are not compatible with being used as a remote module, but our
  workflows aren't used as remote modules.  (Used as a local module is fine.)

  `workflow.basedir` is the current `Snakefile`'s dir, e.g. dir of top-level `Snakefile`.
  `workflow.current_basedir` is the current Snakemake file's dir, e.g. `…/rules/` for a `…/rules/abc.smk`.
  In the top-level `Snakefile`, they're the same.
