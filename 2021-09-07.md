# 7 September 2021
# or, A short week

With the holiday Monday and vacation starting Friday, I'm only working three
days this week.

## On my mind

  - Group for Ivan
  - EH&S training due
  - Lab meeting!
  - Continue work on Groups with CLI and web API
  - Review Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
  - Putting aside docs work for now; last week was a good push on it

## Lingering thoughts on docs

A partial list of docs improvements I'd like to do, but which I'm going to punt
for now:

  - Rewrite Groups page to add more explanatory and how-to content; maybe split
    into a whole separate section?

  - Spend a few days doing a pass on the CLI docs to substantially improve
    them.

  - Revisit unified TOC/sidebar approaches.

  - More on Narratives, c.f. https://discussion.nextstrain.org/t/display-an-image-in-a-narrative/736

Plus, additional suggestions [from
James](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C01LCTT7JNN/p1630900155016900):

  - Subproject page header could replace (e.g.) “Docs >> $pageTitle” with
    “Nextstrain Docs >> Nextclade docs >> $pageTitle”

  - Top of the sidebar could be improved to convey we’re in a subproject (my
    implementation was a temporary solution)

  - Ideally search would not just search that subproject, but I think that’s
    out of our control.

I'm +1 on these!

The last one I think we can have control over, but we'll have to make sure to
handle versions properly.  Instead of using the project-specific searchbox, our
theme's template would include the top-level searchbox instead. We'd probably
want to revert to a project-specific search box though if you visit a specific
version of a subproject. Need to consider this.

I'm happy to do some more smoothing on the docs and would still like to
implement the unified TOC/sidebar, but I'm going to set aside docs work for now
and re-focus on other priorities. (And then I'm out for a week.) I can spin
round to it later if someone else doesn't first.
