XXX TODO: Pros and cons of v2, from 2018-12-26 notes


XXX FIXME: Operations on _datasets_ and _narratives_ not _files_ or _prefixes_.


Resources exposed via the API are:

  * Dataset collection
    * Dataset
      * Dataset sidecar
  * Narrative collection
    * Narrative

Response media types are:

  * `application/json` (`.json`)
  * `text/markdown` (`.md`)

They may be requested via the `Accept` header or extensions appended to the URL
path.

Request media types (e.g. for PUT) are:

  * `application/json` (`.json`)
  * `text/markdown` (`.md`)
  * `application/zip` (`.zip`)

They may be declared via the `Content-Type` header or extensions appended to
the URL path.

Request encodings may be:

  * `gzip`
  * `deflate`
