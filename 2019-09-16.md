# nextstrain.org/flu and who.nextflu.org

Trevor, Barney, John, Jover, Thomas

The state of flu, prior to Barney's departure.


## Fauna

### vdb (virus database)

* GISAID

e.g.

    python vdb/flu_upload.py

Run weekly.

Manual click through searching, but can be an automated download soon.

### tdb (titers database)

* CDC emails seasonally-cumulative spreadsheets
* Crick
* VIDRL
* NIID
* (CCDC)

e.g.

    python tdb/upload_all.py
    python tdb/cdc_upload.py
    python tdb/niid_upload.py

Data comes from

* email
* Dropbox
* [GitHub fludata org](https://github.com/fludata)

Data from all sources is normalized to CDC format.

Want an authoritative titers dataset.

No overlap between data sources.

Upload to tdb is an upsert.


## nextstrain/seasonal-flu

### nextstrain.org/flu

    python batch.py --system batch [--lineages h3n2 h1n1pdm [...]]
    nextstrain deploy auspice/*.json

Run weekly.

### who.nextflu.org

    python batch.py --version who
    mv auspice-who/* ../nextflu/auspice/data/
    cd ../nextflu/
    bundle jekyll serve ...
    aero deploy

Run weekly?

To become nextstrain.org/who-gisrs, we need to solve titers {visualization, surfacing} in Auspice.


## Next steps

From Trevor:

1. Improve deploy steps for who.nextflu.org by improving partial data updates
2. Migrate to Nextstrain
3. Migration away from Fauna


## User goals for titers

"I have this serum.  How good is it?"

Global view of antigenic diversity.


## Maintenance goals

* Automate more of the weekly updates
  - Updates for new locations?
  - Misspellings and other manual QC tasks

* Build reliability

* Make deploys and partial update deploys easier

* Faster downloads from RethinkDB
  - Tuning? trs will try this.
  - Caching of static FASTAs on S3
