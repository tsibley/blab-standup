# or, files structure

- data.nextstrain.org/files/ structure
  - JSON file location
    - would love if this was slashed instead of underscores

  - counts data

- `nextstrain remote` upload/download behaviour with local files

- my 2Â¢
  - preserve dataset/build name "ncov/open/north-america" without splitting it
    up (e.g. splitting by repo or pathogen name) to make
    mapping/cross-linking/discovery easier/clearer.

  - listings
    - traditional index.html files
      - statically generated periodically from S3 inventory files?
      - periodically-provisioned with client-side dynamic listings?
    - search/filter/browse interface on nextstrain.org/data
