- James' thoughts
  - <https://bedfordlab.slack.com/files/U1LUX6ULW/F03DZUHSLE7/file_structure.pdf>

- my own quick thoughts
  - preserve dataset/build name "ncov/open/north-america" without splitting it
    up (e.g. splitting by repo or pathogen name) to make
    mapping/cross-linking/discovery easier/clearer.

  - similarly, avoid using pathogen names or repo names at all in paths (except
    where they're included in dataset/build names).

  - listings
    - traditional index.html files
      - statically generated periodically from S3 inventory files?
      - periodically-provisioned with client-side dynamic listings?
    - search/filter/browse interface on nextstrain.org/data

  - would love if Auspice files were slashed instead of underscores, e.g. used
    the same paths we use for files/ncov/open/global/global.json (but without
    repetition, so open/global.json or open/global/main.json)
