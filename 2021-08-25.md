# or, Nextstrain JSON files

Thinking through our data model for CLI and API work, I found myself writing down
what JSON files we use where in order to help orient myself.

I plan to incorporate what's below into
<https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/reference/formats/data-formats.html>.

Nextstrain uses a few different kinds of JSON files at various stages in a
typical build.

The primary JSON files used by Nextstrain are those consumed by Auspice to
display a __dataset__.  These are typically the final output of a build as
produced by the Augur command `augur export` and come in two versions:

  - v2, with a filename of your choosing like `${name}.json`.  This is often
    referred to as the "main" file.

  - v1, with filenames like `${name}_tree.json` and `${name}_meta.json`, often
    referred to as the "tree" and "meta" files.

The secondary JSON files used by Nextstrain come in two flavors: __sidecar__
files and __node data__ files.

__Sidecar files__ are produced by Augur for direct consumption by Auspice,
alongside the primary JSON files described above.  They come in two types with
filenames enforced by convention:

  - `root-sequence`, with a filename like `${name}_root-sequence.json`,
    produced by `augur export v2`'s `--include-root-sequence` option.

  - `tip-frequencies`, with a filename like `${name}_tip-frequencies.json`,
    produced by `augur frequencies` with the `--output-format auspice --output
    â€¦` options.

__Node data__ files are typically produced by various Augur commands like `augur
traits` or `augur ancestral` and are then fed into `augur export` to be merged
together into a final output for Auspice.  Node data files can have any
filename you want but some common names are:

  - `nt_muts.json`
  - `aa_muts.json`
  - `traits.json`
  - `branch_lengths.json`
  - `${name}_aa-mutation-frequencies.json`
  - `${name}_entropy.json`
  - `${name}_frequencies.json`
  - `${name}_sequences.json`
  - `${name}_titers.json`

Node data files have a generic structure to allow them to contain all kinds of
data about your tree.  In advanced builds, custom node data files are often
produced by build-specific scripts in addition to the ones produced by Augur
commands.
