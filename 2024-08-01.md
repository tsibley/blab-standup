### tasks

- [x] newline handling final bits and merge
- [x] nextstrain.org content-disposition filename
- [x] `augur merge` followups


### priorities

_an iteration on [4 June 2024](2024-06-04.md)_

Pick one or two.

- Groups across the line
  - spell this roadmap out, at very least
  - user invite to group flow
  - user signup flow
  - group signup flow
  - maybe wait on legal questions to be resolved so we have fewer retroactive
    agreements to ensure?

- Workflows as programs: the interface
  - separate state (inputs/outputs) from code (repo)
    - see also --no-upload issues/desires
    - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
    - explicitly wrap all workflow-relative paths (e.g. scripts, default data, etc) in `workflow.source_path(…)` 
    - Then the separate state dir is provided via `--directory`.
  - no user use of git

- Surfacing nextstrain.org data
  - Data files listing ([prototype](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/pull/828))
  - Indexer improvements
    - index groups
    - index community
    - frequency
      - current: daily with additional lag from S3 inventory
      - future: event-based, live database (but that can be rebuilt from inventory, is not precious, etc.)
        - one SQLite writer, litestream to S3, replicated to each dyno
  - RSS/ActivityPub/stars/some way to follow updates on pathogens/datasets/files/etc. ([convo on RSS/ActivityPub](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C0K3GS3J8/p1716325422745399), [convo on stars/views](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C7SDVPBLZ/p1700240721659849))
  - Search (e.g. via [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/))

- System diagrams (i.e. using the [C4 model](https://c4model.com))


JFDI.

- [Charon API endpoints don't respect global dataset-name redirections](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/issues/858)
  - related: [version extractor rationalization](https://gist.github.com/tsibley/fcbe564e7d31dca730affeeff67aaf90)

- Support RESTful API PUT and DELETE endpoints for core and staging

- [nextstrain.org/tmp](https://github.com/nextstrain/.github/issues/36#issuecomment-1474424671)

- [Remotes in CLI doc](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/334)

- [Update "build directory" terminology in CLI help and docs](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/371)

- Writing the "configuring SSL CA certs" guide I've been thinking about would
  be really helpful to both our own team members and CDC's.
