# or, taking inventory

Centralized inventory of resources (datasets and narratives).

SQLite or Postgres database.

Private, access-controlled via RESTful API.

Indexing
  - Incremental indexing via S3 events (sent via SQS to webhook? or to AWS Lambda?)
  - Full reindex from S3 inventory files
  - S3 inventory, Git history, …

  - Opportunistically kept updated incrementally but also fully rebuildable by walking sources.
  - Track community datasets as they’re used  (but don’t return them from results yet?)
    - Redis counters for tracking dataset and narrative hits? Source of info on what exists for community, plus “leaderboard”?

Account for resource versioning

Feeds into metrics and logging system (e.g. Grafana) for visualizing and alerting
