General syntax is `<name>[@<version>[=<url>]]`.

`<name>` without `@<version>` means:

  - "latest stable version" for `setup`
  - "local default version" for `run`
  - "move default to latest stable version" for `update`

Without `=<url>` means "the Nextstrain pathogen `<name>`", implemented as "the
`nextstrain/<name>` repo on GitHub, at ref `<version>`" (at least initially).

Consider resolving this via a tiny API on nextstrain.org.  This lets us
preserve backwards compat from the start for renames, etc. and also gives us
some visibility into usage.

Examples below are meant to show behaviour, not actual output.

```console
$ nextstrain setup measles
downloaded nextstrain/measles main (because no tags)

$ nextstrain setup measles
ERROR: measles already set up; use --force to set up again, or `nextstrain update` to update

$ nextstrain setup --force measles
deleted nextstrain/measles main
downloaded nextstrain/measles main (maybe gets new commits)

$ nextstrain update measles
downloaded nextstrain/measles main (maybe gets new commits)

$ nextstrain setup measles@abadcafe
nextstrain/measles abadcafeâ€¦ (explicit rev)

$ nextstrain run measles
nextstrain/measles main

$ nextstrain run measles@abadcafe
nextstrain/measles abadcafeâ€¦
```

```console
$ nextstrain setup ncov
downloaded nextstrain/ncov v15 (because tags)

$ nextstrain setup ncov
ERROR: ncov already set up; use --force to set up again, or `nextstrain update` to update

$ nextstrain update ncov
downloaded nextstrain/ncov v16
set v16 as default
deleted nextstrain/ncov v15
```


```console
$ nextstrain setup --set-default measles@alt
$ nextstrain setup measles
```
