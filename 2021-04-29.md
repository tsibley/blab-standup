# or, Publishing source and intermediate data files

Trevor wrote four long messages in Slack, each with an associated thread, while
I was out on vacation:

I'm jotting down some notes here as I digest them.

  - +1 for using a prefix (/ncov/gisaid/… and /ncov/open/…) instead of suffix
    (/ncov/…/gisaid and /ncov/…/open) to indicate source of data (e.g. GISAID vs.
    open data).
 
  - +1 for making data file paths closely mirror the nextstrain.org/ncov/… paths.

  - +1 for private data filenames on s3://nextstrain-ncov-private/ to match
    those for the open data on data.nextstrain.org/…/ (s3://nextstrain-data/).
    Principle is that base path + filename are fixed, but the prefix changes
    depending on if we can publish them or not.

  - I know it was my suggestion (right?), but not a huge fan of "raw".  Maybe
    "artifacts" or "builds" or "source-data"?

  - Are we publishing source data at the single dataset level (e.g.
    /ncov/open/north-america) or build level (e.g. all /ncov/open/… datasets)?
    (Or both?)

In the future (or now, if we have a decision for behaviour), we could make this
mirroring even tighter, if we define a URL convention, e.g.

    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/.raw/metadata.tsv
    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/.artifacts/metadata.tsv
    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/.source-data/metadata.tsv
    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/-/metadata.tsv

    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global/.artifacts/
    nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y/.artifacts/
      → file listing, returned directly or via redirect to CDN'd listing

    nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global/.artifacts/metadata.tsv
    nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/2y/.artifacts/metadata.tsv
      → redirect to CDN path
