managed-conda vs. conda vs. ???

Stay close to implementation/engine as it matters and there needs to be some
way to choose?  Or abstract it away further?

If we abstract it away further, then we could have `nextstrain setup foo` DTRT
based on the platform.  e.g. on Linux and macOS it'd do the Conda thing, but on
Windows it'd supplement with non-Conda packages too?  Ironically, this might be
the best use case for the "native" name.  lolsob

But I'm leaning towards keeping the runner/runtime name close to the
implementation/engine as there does always need to be a way to pick these
details, it reduces change/confusion, and it avoids "shifting sands" issues for
runners over time.  e.g. the Conda runtime is always going to be Conda based,
but the "generic non-container install" runtime may be implemented with Conda
one year and something entirely different the next, which seems fraught and
confusing.  **Instead, we'd make new runtimes, deprecate old ones, invest in
good detection of support + setup for each, and rely on folks to get the "best"
for them via `nextstrain check-setup` or a new unqualified `nextstrain setup`
or something.**
