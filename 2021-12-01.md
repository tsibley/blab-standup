- make-fetch-happen caching issues
  - revalidation (forced with cache: no-cache) causing header/body mismatches
    1. make request with compress: false but accept-encoding: gzip and response with content-encoding: gzip
    2. response is cached and returned ok
    3. make same request, forcing revalidation. cache is revalidated and response is returned ok.
    3. make same request, forcing revalidation again. cache is revalidated but response is bad (content-encoding: null).

  - cache doesn't vary on "compress" option

  - default accept-encoding isn't visible in request.headers, so causes caching issues

  - compress disabled but with an accept-encoding isn't handled right

  - compress disabled with no accept-encoding isn't handled right?
