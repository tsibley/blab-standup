## CUE thoughts

_Prompted by <https://github.com/nextstrain/rsv/issues/106#issuecomment-3330906364>._

- One CUE definition for config schema
- One CUE value for default config (complete, passes schema)
- One CUE value for overlaying config (partial, likely does not pass)
- CUE logic for combining default + overlaying configs (complete, passes schema)

How does the overlaying config specify explicitly how to merge with the
defaults?  This is the key.
