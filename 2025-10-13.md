Hey Blab.  I'm sorry to add the change and uncertainty that's in the air this
Fall, but I wanted everyone to know sooner than later that I'll be leaving the
lab in early November.  This has been a while coming for me personally and is
not a result of Trevor's intended shift to Pegasus.  I'm looking forward to
focusing on my family and myself.  I'm happy to talk about things here, in DMs,
or in person (I plan to be in either tomorrow or Wednesday this week).

I think the Nextstrain group does pretty well without me these days, but I'll
be looking to figure out what I should be wrapping up and passing on over the
next few weeks.  If you have suggestions, let me know!
