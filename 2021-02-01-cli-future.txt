pip install nextstrain-cli
  or even better, download a packed executable for your platform which "just runs"
    chmod +x nextstrain


nextstrain setup
  Docker
  Auto-managed Conda env (pairs with "native" runner)

  AWS Batch (eventually)
    - Eventually create resources with CloudFormation/Terraform


nextstrain check-setup
  better output
  better support on Windows




Ideas:
  * Live streaming of files back from remote builds (using Dat)
  * Download selected files (or no files) when attaching to build

  * Tracking of detached builds
      - check status
      - re-attach more easily

  * Satisfying build deps
      - buildpacks!

  * Logging in to nextstrain.org

  * Singularity support (should be very straightforward)
  * GCP support
