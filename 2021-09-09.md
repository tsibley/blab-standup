`build` supports using a pre-baked container image by shortnames:

    nextstrain build ncov
    nextstrain build seasonal-flu
    nextstrain build zika-tutorial

Full image names would be something like `ghcr.io/nextstrain/ncov:latest`.
Tags for versioning and reproducibility.  Could easily use another image
registry.

    nextstrain pack ~/nextstrain/ncov/
    nextstrain pack https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov

This would make an image for the ncov build using a local or remote copy of the
repo.

The `pack` command would read a new build info file, `nextstrain-build.yaml`,
for a few config values.  (If no such file exists, these would also be
  specifiable manually on the `pack` command-line.)
