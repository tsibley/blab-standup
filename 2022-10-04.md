# 4 October 2022
# or, A CLI state of mind

- ~CLI: Make 5.0.0.dev0 release, so we can fully test installers~
- CLI: Update installation doc to include
  - Automatic standalone installation
  - Manual installation with
    - pip
    - pipx

- ~CLI: native → ambient in docs and help~
- CLI: runner → runtime in docs and help
- CLI: new Runtimes doc section (e.g. above/below Remotes)

- ~Address commands available in Docker runtime that aren't in Conda runtime~
  ([ref](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/218#issuecomment-1269082344))

- ~CLI: Use nextstrain meta package instead of listing things separately~
  - <https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C01LCTT7JNN/p1665599068266849>

- Update docs.nextstrain.org install instructions to use `nextstrain setup conda`.

  I have a WIP, but it needs some more consideration of how the doc can
  simplify for new comers but not abandon previous users.

- CLI: fancier console ui that I have a wip for
- CLI: Pin versions of micromamba (overridable by env var) so things don't suddenly break and are debuggable/reproducible


# Zoho Desk

- Deal with primary account
  ~a. Change email away from hello@, or~
  b. Designate new primary and deactivate/remove old one

- ~Switch to yearly billing?~

- Setup new mail account (Fastmail?) for nextstrain.org
  - hello@ as forward into Zoho
  - Then have Zoho relay things to #nextstrain-inbox
  - admin@ as forward into Slack, with reduced visibility?

- Move more service accounts to admin@?
