While I can get Loculus' website app running (see config in
_tom@whunk:nextstrain/sequences-browser/loculus-website/_), it's pretty clear
to me now that running the full app will be painful and untenable, so we'd want
to instead extract the `/search` page and integrate it into nextstrain.org's
Next.js app (e.g. to serve `nextstrain.org/sequences/…`).  i.e. fork the
search/browse pages/components of Loculus' website.

The search page is pretty well contained in source, with not too many
imports/references to code outside of its own component tree.

```console
$ git grep -P --no-line-number -o '[^\s\x27"]*?\.\./[^\s\x27"]*' src/components/SearchPage/ \
>   | while IFS=: read -r src ref; do realpath --canonicalize-missing --relative-base=. "$(dirname "$src")/$ref"; done \
>   | sort -u \
>   | grep -v ^src/components/SearchPage/
src/clientLogger.ts
src/components/common/ErrorBox.tsx
src/components/OffCanvasOverlay.tsx

src/types/lapis.ts
src/types/referencesGenomes
src/types/referencesGenomes.ts
src/types/runtimeConfig.ts
src/utils/search.ts
vitest.setup.ts
```

I think it'll be very reasonable to maintain the search UI as we see fit, and
if we strive to not diverge too far from the upstream source, we would still be
able to backport bug fixes, new features, etc. with relative ease.
