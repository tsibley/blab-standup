## Lab meeting ideas

- Demo of workflows as programs prototype
  See [2023-07-17.md](2023-07-17.md)

- Threads/cores/CPUs/what the heck
  "Demystifying parallelism and concurrency"


## Todo

- Start in on prototyping [the first bits of workflows as programs](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/f7c528dbbdbd23f4c8200a4381e1a377234dd247/2024-08-01.md#L27-L33)
  - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
  - `configfile` directive is relative to `--directory` by default
  - `include` directive is relative to workflow source by default

  - How to handle default configs?

  - I wish we could specify config-relative paths.  I explored options with
    both YTE and YAML tagged values (separately) and they don't provide a
    feasible/reasonable method to implement this.

  - Relative scripts are going to be a problem.
    - `./vendored/foo`
    - `./scripts/bar`

  - `workflow.source_path(…)` has issues
    - It returns paths to shadow copies in Snakemake's source-cache (ugh)
    - It requires files already exist; not just path construction.
    - <https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/1805>
    - <https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/2331>
    - `workflow.current_basedir` works as an alternative, but it won't work
      with remotely-sourced modules (but locally-sourced modules are fine)

  - Best practice: keep paths out of config files, or at least out of default config file

  - questions
    1. Do we want to keep default geolocation and annotation rules as defaults,
       e.g. not overriden but _extended_ by user config?  I'd think so.
