## Lab meeting ideas

- Demo of workflows as programs prototype
  See [2023-07-17.md](2023-07-17.md)

- Threads/cores/CPUs/what the heck
  "Demystifying parallelism and concurrency"


## Todo

- Start in on prototyping [the first bits of workflows as programs](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/f7c528dbbdbd23f4c8200a4381e1a377234dd247/2024-08-01.md#L27-L33)
  - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
  - `configfile` directive is relative to `--directory` by default
  - `include` directive is relative to workflow source by default

  - How to handle default configs?

  - I wish we could specify config-relative paths.  I explored options with
    both YTE and YAML tagged values (separately) and they don't provide a
    feasible/reasonable method to implement this.

  - Relative scripts are going to be a problem.
    - `./vendored/foo`
    - `./scripts/bar`



## Soon

- Complete [BME post-work training](https://fredhutch.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/course/ac23e22d-0445-4123-bd10-66db92646c11)
- Complete [SOGI training](https://fredhutch.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/course/13b01982-4e88-44e0-b275-8e86734ff89d)
- Gather decision on [moving forward with LAPIS/SILO/Loculus search UI](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/143)
