# or, there's something on my mind

_an incomplete braindump_

- Groups migration

  - Consider slight change to storage layout now (instead of later)
    - s3://nextstrain-groups/${group}/datasets/…
    - s3://nextstrain-groups/${group}/narratives/…
    - Makes room at the top-level for other user-provided data (like
      groups-overview.md) as well our own internal control data

  - Draft migration email (see below)
    - Thank them for being early access
    - Describe benefits
      - single credentials
      - roles
    - Don't migrate yet if…
      - …you frequently update your group-overview.md or group-logo.png (see below)
    - Timeline
    - Steps to take
      - Before
        - Ask us to migrate your group
        - Tell us who owners, editors, viewers should be
        - Pick a datetime (or leave it up to us)
        - Upgrade nextstrain-cli in advance (ideally)
      - After
        - Test it out
        - Use new commands going forward
        - Email us with role changes (for now)

  - Collect info about Group requestors/owners

  - Support overview.md and logo.png
    - API
      - /groups/:groupName/~/logo
      - /groups/:groupName/~/overview
    - CLI

  - Groups member management
    - API
      - List members (and associated roles in the group, plural)
      - Add member to role (results in new member or adding role to existing member)
      - Remove member from role
    - CLI? maybe not, but users need some way of interacting?

- Refreshing of user session data
  - <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/issues/81#issuecomment-1051420579>

- Security issues
  - File 'em

- Buildpacks
  - How to make images
  - How to run them
    - Single build dir now becomes image + extra files dir (like with ncov +
      profiles or Terra/WDL)
  - Good update story for software + pipeline + data, etc. with nextstrain
    update.

- Canary deployment

- Automatic redirection to canary
  - User flags
  - API set/toggle endpoints
    - GET /user/:username/flags/canary (body: JSON boolean)
    - PUT /user/:username/flags/canary (body: JSON boolean)
    - POST /user/:username/flags/canary/toggle

    - GET /user/:username/flags (body: JSON object of flag names → values)
    - PUT /user/:username/flags (body: JSON object)
    - PATCH /user/:username/flags (body: partial JSON object merged into existing object)
  - UI for status/toggle

- nextstrain.org logging
  - json lines? (super easy to parse) key=value? (nicer to read, but harder to parse, esp. with quoted values)
  - bunyan

- "Runtime" naming in Nextstrain CLI

- remote download: Local path prefix for multiple datasets, not just directory
  
  If a single part path (i.e. no slashes) which doesn't exist, then treat as
  file basename prefix instead of missing directory.

  If a multi-part path which doesn't exist but where the parent path exists,
  then treat as a path + file basename prefix instead of a missing directory.

- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (uggh)

- A(nother) comprehensive pass on Nextstrain CLI docs to gel them a bit more
  and add a lot of explanatory material.  Most of it is reference right now.

- Rewrite Groups doc page (and nextstrain.org/groups?) to add more explanatory
  and how-to content; maybe split into a whole separate section?

- Env var support in Nextstrain CLI
  - `--envdir my-env.d`
  - `--env FOO` (implemented in terms of an env dir)
  - See bespoke prior art in ncov-ingest here (and 2018-era
    thinking-aloud-as-WIPs in the CLI itself)

- Narratives support for `nextstrain view`
  <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/128#issuecomment-978100714>


- Cool ideas for Nextstrain CLI
  - Revisit pex and cli-wheelhouse work
  - `setup` command
    - Aim is to replace install instructions?
    - Docker
    - Auto-managed Conda env (pairs with "native runner")
    - AWS Batch (?) with CloudFormation/Terraform?
      - Probably very unnecessary.
  - Faster `check-setup`, do things in parallel
  - Local tracking of detached builds
  - Live streaming of files back from remote builds using Dat/Hypercores
  - use Link header to know which sidecars to fetch (avoids enumerating them solely on the client)

- Metrics
  <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdcRqspkOiDqaop7qiRDarG5YAsWKCQG2CIT7s-hrPg/edit#>

- Ephemeral AWS credentials for our GitHub Actions workflows instead of
  hardcoding them.
  - <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments>

- PUT/DELETE support for core and staging
  - Consider the need for CloudFront invalidations?
    - We could sidestep invalidations entirely if we
      - change our caching strategy
      - ditch CloudFront
        - it's mostly accessed only by the server, so the CDN doesn't help much,
          right???
        - most requests seem to be misses anyway??? (because we've misconfigured
          caching?)
  - authz policy could use internal Cognito group, e.g. `@core`

- Setup DMARC for improved nextstrain.org email reputation
  - SPF should be setup already
  - Setup DKIM
    - Zoho Desk
    - Amazon SES (for Cognito)
      - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dmarc.html>
    - Fastmail
  - Add DMARC record

- Audit use of Cache-Control
  - nextstrain.org endpoints
    - Add cache control headers at source routing level.
    - authz pages get private, no-cache (max-age=0, must-revalidate)
    - Other pages get public.

    - Benchmark server local cache vs redirects to cloudfront

    - Check that Charon endpoints support conditional requests….

    - test switching auspice to new endpoints
  - S3 object metadata
  - Cloudfront distribution configuration
    - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html#ExpirationDownloadDist>

    - Fix cloudfront for data.nextstrain.org
    - Use long min TTL since we use invalidations anyway!??
