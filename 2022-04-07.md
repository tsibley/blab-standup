# or, session debugging bad expiry in redis

this error, causing 500s for some users (but not all):

             return req.session.save(next);
           }
           return next();

my understanding:

- connect-redis store uses session.cookie.expires to calculate key TTL

- session (and thus session.cookie) in Redis isn't resaved unless modified
  because we use resave: false

- express-session makes sure to session.touch() before saving, if it's going to
  save, but not if it isn't.

- rolling: true means we send the cookie on every response with a new expires,
  but we _don't_ resave it

- the cookie can thus outlast the original cookie.expires stored in Redis if
  visits keep happening but no changes to session are necessary.  in this case,
  cookie.expires in Redis is effectively the date it was last saved to store +
  30 days (TTL), NOT last visit + 30 days.

- when we manually saved without .touch(), connect-redis calculated a negative
  TTL using an old cookie.expires date from the past.  Redis rejected the SET
  with "invalid expire time".

- REALIZATION: we have sessions for everyone who has started the login process
  even if they haven't completed it, i.e. clicked the login button then gone
  back, or attempted to view a private resource and gotten redirected to login.
  I knew this at one point but completely forgot until realizing it again
  today.

- affected users are those with a session cookie (so last visited in past 30
  days) whose session itself was last saved to Redis over 30 days ago.


This understanding obtained by:

- reading code of express-session and connect-redis
- reading https://github.com/tj/connect-redis/issues/292
- reading https://github.com/expressjs/session/issues/718

- inspecting contents of Redis, although problematic sessions of Jover and
  Jennifer were maybe lost or at least not identifiable.  (maybe should put IPs
  in sessions?!)

      # redis-cli wrapper that pulls creds from `heroku redis:info`
      heroku-redis-cli nextstrain-server --rdb dump.rdb

      # pipx install rdbtools
      rdb -c json -f dump.json dump.rdb
      jq -c '.[0] | to_entries | .[]' < dump.json > dump-0.ndjson

      # explore with visidata and parse/expand columns, etc.
      vd dump-0.ndjson


Testing:

- Reproduce locally if possible

- If can't, or maybe regardless, consider making .save() failure non-fatal.
  Log about it with some detailed context for debugging, but allow the
  Redis-persisted session.cookie to not have the right "domain".


[Update 22:52] I reproduced locally.

Run a production-like Redis locally:

    docker run --rm -it -p 6379:6379 redis:5.0

Put a dummy TLS socket in front of it on one port higher since this is how
Heroku's Redis works and what the app expects:

    sudo socat openssl-listen:6380,reuseaddr,fork,cert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem,key=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key,verify=0 tcp4:localhost:6379

Connect to it with redis-cli for interactive manipulation:

    redis.cli -h localhost -p 6380 --tls --insecure

Run the nextstrain.org server with the env var:

    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

(It will use that to connect over `rediss://localhost:6380` instead.)

Establish a session where session.cookie.domain is not defined.  This can be
done by using an older version of the code, but that isn't strictly necessary
to test just this small cookie.domain bit due to the definition of
`SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`.

Note that the session works fine.

Stop the server.

In the redis-cli, determine the session key and backdate the cookie.expires
value.  Lots of ways to do this; I used setrange.

This simulates the understanding of the issue as described above.

Apply the following diff temporarily to the domain-setting server code:

    diff --git a/src/authn/index.js b/src/authn/index.js
    index 50d782a..aa59eba 100644

     const SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = PRODUCTION
       ? "nextstrain.org"
    -  : undefined;

This simulates production mode where the buggy code setting
req.session.cookie.domain will be called.

Start the server again.

Load a page and notice that you get the same 500 error at the top of these
notes.

Apply the proposed fix and restart the server.

Load a page and notice that all is well again. Confirm the session is updated
in Redis to include cookie.domain, by observing that the log lines from the
server only appear on the first request and that the key value in Redis is
actually changed.


Future improvements:

- better logging of request context so debugging/identifying issues is easier

- storing IPs associated with a session in the session itself?  let's us match
  with users even who aren't logged in, or who lose/clear their cookies without
  logging out.
