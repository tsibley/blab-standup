# or, session debugging bad expiry in redis

this error, causing 500s for some users (but not all):

my understanding:

- connect-redis store uses session.cookie.expires to calculate key TTL

- session (and thus session.cookie) in Redis isn't resaved unless modified

- express-session makes sure to session.touch() before saving, if it's going to
  save, but not if it isn't.

- rolling: true means we send the cookie on every response with a new expires,
  but we _don't_ resave it

- the cookie can thus outlast the original cookie.expires stored in Redis if
  visits keep happening but no changes to session are necessary.  in this case,
  cookie.expires in Redis is effectively the date it was last saved to store +
  30 days (TTL), NOT last visit + 30 days.

- when we manually saved without .touch(), connect-redis calculated a negative
  TTL using an old cookie.expires date from the past.  Redis rejected the SET
  with "invalid expire time".

- REALIZATION: we have sessions for everyone who has started the login process
  even if they haven't completed it, i.e. clicked the login button then gone
  back, or attempted to view a private resource and gotten redirected to login.
  I knew this at one point but completely forgot until realizing it again
  today.

- affected users are those with a session cookie (so last visited in past 30
  days) whose session itself was last saved to Redis over 30 days ago.


This understanding obtained by:

- reading code of express-session and connect-redis
- reading https://github.com/tj/connect-redis/issues/292
- reading https://github.com/expressjs/session/issues/718

- inspecting contents of Redis, although problematic sessions of Jover and
  Jennifer were maybe lost or at least not identifiable.  (maybe should put IPs
  in sessions?!)

      # redis-cli wrapper that pulls creds from `heroku redis:info`
      heroku-redis-cli nextstrain-server --rdb dump.rdb

      # pipx install rdbtools
      rdb -c json -f dump.json dump.rdb
      jq -c '.[0] | to_entries | .[]' < dump.json > dump-0.ndjson

      # explore with visidata and parse/expand columns, etc.
      vd dump-0.ndjson


Future improvements:

- better logging of request context so debugging/identifying issues is easier

- storing IPs associated with a session in the session itself?  let's us match
  with users even who aren't logged in, or who lose/clear their cookies without
  logging out.
