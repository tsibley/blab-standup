`pyoxidizer build` succeeded, but produced an executable that immediately
failed with a `ValueError` deep in an import chain at start up.

At first I thought this was maybe a result of big changes I'd been making on a
branch, but switching back to `master` revealed it wasn't.

Looking closer, it became clear that certifi's use of the importlib API was
implicated.  Since certifi isn't a new dep and we haven't changed Python
versions for the PyOxidizer build, this implied a new release of certifi.
Checking previous CI build logs, we were using certifi 2022.06.15 successfully,
and the failing build on my local computer was using 2022.06.15.1.  What
changed?  Well, certifi started testing the Python version to detect support
for the newest importlib API on the block, "Traversable", and since we use 3.10
for the PyOxidizer builds, it was detecting support.  But OxidizedImporter
doesn't actually support that API yet, and on 3.10 the `DegenerateFiles` class
in `Lib/importlib/_adapters.py` is returned, which throws an empty `ValueError`
on `.open()`.  Lovely.

Workarounds are to either:

1. avoid certifi 2022.06.15.1 in our build
2. use Python <=3.8 in our build (so certifi uses the older importlib API that's supported by OxidizedImporter)

Option 2 seems better ultimately since eventually we'll need to take certifi
updates and who knows if they'll fix the feature detection.

Todo:

- file bug with certifi?  should be detecting support on `certifi.__loader__` or similar instead.
- comment on the PyOxidizer issue above where this sort of thing is discussed
- separately, file feature request with PyOxidizer to support the "Traversable" API?
