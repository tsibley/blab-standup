# or, nextstrain.org routing hell

- Express routes in `server.js`
- Static HTML tree generated by Gatsby, when served
- Gatsby client-side routes, when any Gatsby HTML is served
- Auspice client-side routes, when `auspice-client/dist/index.html` is served


Once we don't need our Auspice splash page customization
(`auspice-client/customizations/splash.js`), add

    "entryPage": "datasetLoader"
    
to `auspice-client/customizations/config.json` so that Auspice boots directly
into loading a dataset and doesn't try to do its own client-side routing.
