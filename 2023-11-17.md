    url, context = remote.login_url()

    print(url)
    return_url = input() # or via webserver

    user = remote.complete_login(context, return_url)
      code, state = URL(return_url).query_fields ...
      check state in context
      exchange code for tokens
      return user


but the above has to know where to listen, which makes it complicated to have
an interface boundary.  easier to put it all in the remote.login() call.
