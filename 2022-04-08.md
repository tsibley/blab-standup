# 8 April 2022
# or, what to get back to

- Pick up <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/169> again
  
  Create follow up tasks from initial response
  <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/issues/169#issuecomment-1093294476>

- Get group migrations rolling again, at least further preparations

- Revisit [braindump of priorities from early March](2022-03-10.md), with
  particular focus on:

  - Things important for Groups migrations

  - Self-service Group customizations management
    - API endpoints
    - CLI commands

  - Refreshing of session data for updates from Cognito since staleness matters more now
    - <https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/issues/81#issuecomment-1051420579>

  - Buildpacks!
