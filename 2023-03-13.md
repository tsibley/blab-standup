# or, oh what to do, what to do

[I wrote in Slack](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C0A0ASW4C/p1666301310078009?thread_ts=1666283911.082139&cid=C0A0ASW4C), back in October 2022:

and, relatedly, in early December [emailed myself](message-id://6C24580F-15AD-40CE-9DC3-46DEEBCD78BC@zulutango.org):

These topics might be the most fruitful.


## maybes

- "Paths and environments" (shell, Python, Conda, etc.)
- SQL
- automated testing
- internals of… something…
  - HTTP?


## a through line

- Define some terms and history
  - Shell vs. terminal
  - Shell
    - Bourne again shell
    - Z shell
    - C shell
    - Tiny C shell
    - > Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command
      > interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement
      > runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and
      > programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language,
      > shaped as much by history as by design.

  - Terminal
    - Software (emulators)
      - Terminal.app
      - Gnome Terminal or xterm
    - Hardware
      - Video terminals
        - Digital Equipment Corporation VT100 (insert photo)
      - Teletype

- Start with how your shell finds commands
  - programs vs. functions vs. aliases vs. builtins
  - `PATH`, `hash`
  - How to find out what your shell _will_ execute before it does
  - `type`, `command`, `builtin`
  - layering and shadowing
  - dynamic

- A pattern promulgated
  - Python
    - `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`
  - equivalent "search paths" are pervasive in computing with any sort of
    libraries, modules, packages, etc.
    - DLL hell → Python environment hell

- virtualenv and conda-like environments
  - obligatory https://xkcd.com/1987/
  - dynamically modify `PATH` (and maybe a few other things)
  - not: pyenv-like environments which use shims
  - show effects of activation and deactivation
  - manually simulate them
    - briefly mention caveats
  - running things without activation

- Nextstrain's Conda runtime
  - demo it in a fresh VM for effect
  - then explain how it works

- A package of packages
  - conda-base meta-package
