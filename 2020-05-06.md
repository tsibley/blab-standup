# VisiData

You can think of it as a sort of terminal-based spreadsheet which supports
calculations and manipulations using Python.

Terminal-based programs tend to have a steeper learning curve but reward
practice with a powerful set of tools.


# Modal interface

The interface for VisiData is modal.  That means that your keyboard isn't
_just_ for writing words but also (or even primarily) for performing actions
interactively.  The "F" key is now a button that means "show me a frequency
table for this column" instead of just the letter "F".
