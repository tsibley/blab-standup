Spurred by [several](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/419#discussion_r1984007486) [review](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/pull/103#discussion_r1980458646) [comments](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/pull/103#discussion_r1980499684)…

Should the `nextstrain run` interface directly allow local, non-setup pathogens
to make development easier?

Maybe distinguish managed pathogens vs. non-managed pathogens by
absence/presence of a path separator?

    # Managed
    nextstrain run avian-flu segment-focused /tmp/analysis
    nextstrain run avian-flu@v2 segment-focused /tmp/analysis

    # Unmanaged
    nextstrain run ./avian-flu segment-focused /tmp/analyis

    cd avian-flu
    nextstrain run ./ segment-focused /tmp/analysis

and maybe special case just `.` too for convenience?

    nextstrain run . segment-focused /tmp/analysis

Note that we'd still keep pathogen and workflow as separate arguments so that
workflows are still *names* and can be resolved via pathogen registration
metadata in the future.

This interface change would be instead of allowing local "editable" development
setups, e.g. something like:

    nextstrain setup avian-flu@dev=file://$HOME/nextstrain/avian-flu
    nextstrain setup avian-flu@dev=./avian-flu

    cd avian-flu
    nextstrain setup avian-flu@dev=.

Both are possible, of course, but I think we'd want just one way to do it?
