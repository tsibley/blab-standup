## Docker runtime install

Download <https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg>

Install it:

    hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
    /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
    hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker

Then start the GUI app, which will prompt for privilege escalation to complete setup:

    open /Applications/Docker.app

It takes a few seconds for the daemon to fully start after privileged setup is
complete.

On first `docker run`, another permission needed to be granted for access to
mount the host filesystem (at least in my case with _~/Downloads/_).


I manually enabled VirtioFS in Docker Desktop's preferences, as it's supposed
to be better I/O performance for bind mounts.

Oh, but then disabled it, because: https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6614
