# 1 June 2022
# or, â€¦

## Now

- Migrate neherlab and swiss Groups

- Update filenames and URLs document to reflect latest decisions

- `nextstrain remote download` and `upload` behaviour tweaks

  - remote upload: when to use local filename and when to not
  - remote download: include more of URL in the local filename
  - remote download: Local path prefix for multiple datasets, not just directory
    
    If a single part path (i.e. no slashes) which doesn't exist, then treat as
    file basename prefix instead of missing directory.

    If a multi-part path which doesn't exist but where the parent path exists,
    then treat as a path + file basename prefix instead of a missing directory.
