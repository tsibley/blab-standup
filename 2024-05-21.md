# or, this started small, then grew

Pick one or two.

- Groups across the line
  - spell this roadmap out, at very least
  - wait on legal questions to be resolved so we have less retroactive agreements to ensure?

- Workflows as programs: the interface
  - separate state (inputs/outputs) from code (repo)
    - see also --no-upload issues/desires
    - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
    - explicitly wrap all workflow-relative paths (e.g. scripts, default data, etc) in `workflow.source_path(…)` 
    - Then the separate state dir is provided via `--directory`.
  - no user use of git

- Workflows as programs: the artifacts/bundling
  - per-repo deps
  - released artifacts (image + conda meta package, buildpacks, etc)
  - all my previous notes/thinking/talks/etc on this topic

- Indexer improvements
  - index groups
  - index community
  - frequency
    - current: daily with additional lag from S3 inventory
    - future: event-based, live database (but that can be rebuilt from inventory, is not precious, etc.)
      - one SQLite writer, litestream to S3, replicated to each dyno

- ActivityPub accounts for every pathogen, dataset, and data file…

Maybe JFDI.

- Writing the "configuring SSL CA certs" guide I've been thinking about would
  be really helpful to both our own team members and CDC's.
