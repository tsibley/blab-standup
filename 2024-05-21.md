# or, this started small, then grew

Pick one or two.

- Groups across the line
  - spell this roadmap out, at very least
  - user invite to group flow
  - user signup flow
  - group signup flow
  - maybe wait on legal questions to be resolved so we have fewer retroactive
    agreements to ensure?

- Workflows as programs: the interface
  - separate state (inputs/outputs) from code (repo)
    - see also --no-upload issues/desires
    - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
    - explicitly wrap all workflow-relative paths (e.g. scripts, default data, etc) in `workflow.source_path(â€¦)` 
    - Then the separate state dir is provided via `--directory`.
  - no user use of git

- Workflows as programs: the artifacts/bundling
  - per-repo deps
  - released artifacts (image + conda meta package, buildpacks, etc)
  - all my previous notes/thinking/talks/etc on this topic

- Surfacing nextstrain.org data
  - Data files listing ([prototype](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/pull/828))
  - Indexer improvements
    - index groups
    - index community
    - frequency
      - current: daily with additional lag from S3 inventory
      - future: event-based, live database (but that can be rebuilt from inventory, is not precious, etc.)
        - one SQLite writer, litestream to S3, replicated to each dyno
  - RSS/ActivityPub/stars/some way to follow updates on pathogens/datasets/files/etc. ([convo on RSS/ActivityPub](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C0K3GS3J8/p1716325422745399), [convo on stars/views](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C7SDVPBLZ/p1700240721659849))
