- Strategy/goals
  - Want to tackle ~one of these strategic big projects
  - Rationale for them
  - Desire to "move on" from existing projects, keep building on the
    fundamental foundations I’ve laid

  - [Ephemeral AWS credentials for our GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/22)


- Workflows as programs
  - (do this now)
  - No user use of Git
  - Buildpacks, maybe
  - How does config and other params/files work?
  - CI and other automation for them
  - Increases access and adoption
  - Increases ability to do more with the same people
  - Enables more pathogen analyses
  - Helps define our standard workflow form and interface, even before we handle arbitrary deps (eg buildpacks)


- Ingest as part of our workflows (which are programs)
  - Prototype the first one so others can copy
  - Good QC is essential for full automation


- Dream of federated sequence sharing
  - Sequence sharing with and without depositories
  - local GenBank in a box


- Turn key automation system for production workflows
  - Enabled by workflows as programs

  - Compute platform with a good management features
    - Probably Terra for strategic reasons?
      - but limitations with config var/files may push us away
    - maaaaybe AWS Batch + a custom dashboard on top, but there are significant downsides

  - Dashboard
    - one workflow per row
    - columns in reverse chronological order showing status of last N runs
    - deep links to logs, outputs, etc.

  - Plug-and-play, minimal setup for our pathogen build repos
    - e.g. add a stock GitHub Actions workflow and now you get scheduled builds
    - establish conventions for repo layout, etc.
    - similar to the bespoke automation we have for ncov/ncov-ingest and monkeypox
    - akin to how our pathogen repos all have CI now that's plug-and-play


- Hiring
  - Would be great, don't want to lead it myself
  - Senior software engineer
  - “Bioinformatic engineer” who can dive in and take on the workflows
  - Community manager
