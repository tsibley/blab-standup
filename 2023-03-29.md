## the topline

Pick ~one of a these strategic big projects.

- nextstrain.org
- workflows as programs
- internal operational infrastructure
- federated sequence sharing



## in more detail

- Strategy/goals
  - Want to tackle ~one of these strategic big projects
  - Rationale for them
  - Desire to "move on" from existing projects, keep building on the
    fundamental foundations I’ve laid


- nextstrain.org
  - Groups
    - [membership management API](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/pull/581)
      - tests
      - new user signup story
    - UI
      - membership management
      - customizations
  - Search (see [2022-03-10](2022-03-10.md))
  - [Ditching Gatsby](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/88) ([my original thoughts](2023-03-16.md))
  - [Cognito user pool changes](2022-12-02.md)
  - [Metrics (and logging)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdcRqspkOiDqaop7qiRDarG5YAsWKCQG2CIT7s-hrPg)


- Workflows as programs
  - (do this now)
  - No user use of Git
  - Buildpacks, maybe
  - How does config and other params/files work?
  - CI and other automation for them
  - Increases access and adoption
  - Increases ability to do more with the same people
  - Enables more pathogen analyses
  - Helps define our standard workflow form and interface, even before we handle arbitrary deps (eg buildpacks)


- Internal operational infrastructure
  - [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/90)

  - [Cognito user pool changes](2022-12-02.md)

  - [Metrics (and logging)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdcRqspkOiDqaop7qiRDarG5YAsWKCQG2CIT7s-hrPg)

  - [Ephemeral AWS credentials for our GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/nextstrain/private/issues/22)

  - Turn key automation system for production workflows
    - Enabled by workflows as programs

    - Compute platform with a good management features
      - Probably Terra for strategic reasons?
        - but limitations with config var/files may push us away
      - maaaaybe AWS Batch + a custom dashboard on top, but there are significant downsides

    - Dashboard
      - one workflow per row
      - columns in reverse chronological order showing status of last N runs
      - deep links to logs, outputs, etc.

    - Plug-and-play, minimal setup for our pathogen build repos
      - e.g. add a stock GitHub Actions workflow and now you get scheduled builds
      - establish conventions for repo layout, etc.
      - similar to the bespoke automation we have for ncov/ncov-ingest and monkeypox
      - akin to how our pathogen repos all have CI now that's plug-and-play

  - Ingest as part of our workflows (which are programs)
    - Interfaces
    - Golden path
    - Deviating from the golden path
    - `augur curate`
    - Good QC; essential for full automation
    - Prototype for one or two workflows so others can adopt it into the rest of
      our workflows and continue development ("show the way")


- Dream of federated sequence sharing
  - Sequence sharing with and without depositories
  - local GenBank in a box


- Hiring
  - Would be great, don't want to lead it myself
  - Senior software engineer
  - “Bioinformatic engineer” who can dive in and take on the workflows
  - Community manager
