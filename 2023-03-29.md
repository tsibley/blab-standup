  Ditching Gatsby


Workflows as programs
  (do this now)
  No user use of Git
  Buildpacks, maybe
  How does config and other params/files work?
  CI and other automation for them
  Increases access and adoption
  Increases ability to do more with the same people
  Enables more pathogen analyses
  Helps define our standard workflow form and interface, even before we handle arbitrary deps (eg buildpacks)


Ingest as part of our workflows (which are programs)
  Prototype the first one so others can copy
  Good QC is essential for full automation


Dream of federated sequence sharing
  Sequence sharing with and without depositories
  local GenBank in a box


Strategy/goals
  Want to tackle one of these strategic big projects
    Rationale for them
    Desire to move on, keep building on the foundations I’ve laid


Productionized turn key build automation
  Enabled by workflows as programs
    Leverage standard workflow config file (e.g. `nextstrain.yaml` or whatever)
    that I imagine exists for workflows as programs and/or Buildpacks

  On Terra?
    Maybe, maybe not
    May not be adept enough, e.g. around config vars


Hiring
  Senior dev would be great
  “Bioinformatic engineer” who can dive in and take on the workflows would be great
  Community manager a plus
