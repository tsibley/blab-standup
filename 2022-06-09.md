# or, `recs` examples

@jameshadfield [gave these examples](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/issues/860#issuecomment-1150642112):

> I'm thinking about how we would support data that wasn't row-based (like sequences + metadata are). For instance, given the following dataset:

> AAA | Auckland | -37 | 174 | B.1.1 | #F020E2

> I've written scripts at various points in time to extract out:
> * a colours TSV mapping lineage -> hex. (Including some form of colour averaging if there are multiple hexes per lineage, which happens.)
> * A city -> lat/long TSV, which sets the lat/long based on the average of observed lat/longs for each city. Here there'd be 2 demes: Auckland, Wellington
> * A new metadata column which contains the unique lat/longs observed in the dataset, and a corresponding lat/long TSV file. Here there would be 3 demes, but we may also parametrise this to aggregate so that there are fewer. 

and [asked in
Slack](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C01LCTT7JNN/p1654804775348649)
about how one might do them with `tsv-utils` and/or `csvtk`.

I haven't used `tsv-utils` or `csvtk` much, so I offered to demonstrate in
`recs`, if that'd be helpful, given that I'd recently presented in lab meeting
on the ideas in `recs` as they related to the hypothetical `augur transform`.

First, I produced a CSV of the example input data by running:

```
vd https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/issues/860
```

then selecting the correct table from the list, and then copying it to my
clipboard as a CSV (`gs`, `gY`, `csv`, `<return>`):

```csv
ID,city,latitude,longitude,lineage,lineage__color
AAA,Auckland,-37,174,B.1.1,#F020E2
BBB,Auckland,-39,175,C.12,#20C9F0
CCC,Wellington,-41,174,C.12,#20C9F0
```

Then I started addressing each example, documenting them below.

As a neat trick, you can run this Markdown file with:

```
cram --shell=/bin/bash --indent=4 2022-06-09.md
```

to check the examples all work!  A little setup and recursive test for that is
below.

    $ pushd "$TESTDIR" >/dev/null

    $ perl -ne 'print if /^```csv$/ ... (/^```$/ and exit)' "$TESTFILE" | tail -n +2 | tee "$(basename "$TESTFILE" .md)-examples.csv"
    ID,city,latitude,longitude,lineage,lineage__color
    AAA,Auckland,-37,174,B.1.1,#F020E2
    BBB,Auckland,-39,175,C.12,#20C9F0
    CCC,Wellington,-41,174,C.12,#20C9F0

    $ if [[ -z "${RECURSING:-}" ]]; then RECURSING=1 cram --shell=/bin/bash --indent=4 "$TESTFILE"; else exit 80; fi
    s
    # Ran 1 tests, 1 skipped, 0 failed.

## lineage → color map

Without average, just picking the first color that appears for a lineage:

    $ recs fromcsv --header 2022-06-09-examples.csv \
    > | recs collate -k lineage -a color=first,lineage__color \
    > | recs tocsv -d $'\t' -k lineage,color
    lineage	color
    B.1.1	#F020E2
    C.12	#20C9F0

Averaging the colors would be possible, but you'd have to write a custom
aggregation function, the implementation of which would depend on what sort of
average you want to take.  I would probably do this by aggregating by lineage
with `recs` and piping the NDJSON to another command to do the color averaging,
which is part of the handiness of well-defined interfaces.  For example,
replace the `(exit 80)` below with a command that reads NDJSON with a `colors`
field (array of hex values) and writes NDJSON with a `color` field:

    $ recs fromcsv --header 2022-06-09-examples.csv \
    > | recs collate -k lineage -a colors=array,lineage__color \
    > | (exit 80) \
    > | recs tocsv -d $'\t' -k lineage,color

But as an example of doing it all in recs, here's averaging the RGB channels
separately to get a final value:

    $ recs fromcsv --header 2022-06-09-examples.csv \
    > | recs xform '@$r{qw[r g b]} = map hex, $r->{lineage__color} =~ /^#(..)(..)(..)$/' \
    > | recs collate -k lineage -a avg,r -a avg,g -a avg,b \
    > | recs xform '$r->{color} = "#" . join "", map { uc sprintf "%x", $_ } @$r{qw[avg_r avg_g avg_b]}' \
    > | recs tocsv -d $'\t' -k lineage,color
    lineage	color
    B.1.1	#F020E2
    C.12	#20C9F0

Note that the "averaged" values are the same because there aren't different
input colors for a lineage.

## city → lat/lng map

    $ recs fromcsv --header 2022-06-09-examples.csv \
    > | recs collate -k city -a lat=avg,latitude -a lng=avg,longitude \
    > | recs tocsv -d $'\t' -k city,lat,lng
    city	lat	lng
    Auckland	-38	174.5
    Wellington	-41	174

## unique lat/lngs

Not sure I understood the example as described, but this produces the unique
lat/lngs as a two-column TSV, sorted by decreasing latitude first and then
increasing longitude.

    $ recs fromcsv --header 2022-06-09-examples.csv \
    > | recs collate -k latitude,longitude \
    > | recs sort -k latitude=-n,longitude=n \
    > | recs tocsv -d $'\t' -k latitude,longitude
    latitude	longitude
    -37	174
    -39	175
    -41	174
