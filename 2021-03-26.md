# 26 March 2021
# or, Coalescing more Charon v2 thoughts

## TODO

  * Custom mime types for Nextstrain JSON schemas; versioned
  * Require extensions (.json, .md) in URLs?  Having them maybe makes
    implementing this API with static hosting possible?

  * Should this "API" actually just act like a file system?

  * /charon/v2/source/{name}

  * Nextstrain.org routing must be more specific about what paths it hands to Auspice.  Intent is that Auspice is only used for displaying datasets, and that we avoid Auspice's "splash page".
    * This means the server checks for existence before sending the Auspice entrypoint.  204 responses would be eliminated (as could be the corresponding handling check in Auspice) and the isRequestValidWithoutDataset property.

  * How to list datasets related to a given "source" (without Auspice caring
    about "sources")?  Generic "related dataset" endpoint?


* List all (enumerable) datasets available to current user
* Retrieve dataset (e.g. main or tree+meta (combined server-side))
* Retrieve dataset sidecars


Enumerable means that they can and should be included in listings.  For
example, /community/… datasets likely won't be enumerable initially, but they
could be in the future after an indexing process (potentially based on
[community-search][] is sorted out.  As another example, /staging/… datasets
are unlikely to ever be marked enumerable, even though we could.  Or maybe we'd
mark them enumerable only for core build maintainers.

## Purpose and goals

  * RESTful operations on _concepts_ like datasets and narratives rather than
   _files_

  * Stable foundation and framework for future additions and changes

  * Serves needs of multiple audiences/clients
    - Auspice
    - Nextstrain CLI (`nextstrain remote {list,download,upload,delete}` commands)
    - Nextstrain Groups web interface
    - Auctor (narrative editor)
    - Third-party integrations (IDSeq, Aspen, etc)

  * ...


## Base URL

All resources reside as subpaths of <https://nextstrain.org/charon/v2/>.


## Resources

Resources exposed via the API are:

  - Dataset collection
    - Dataset
      - Dataset sidecar
  - Narrative collection
    - Narrative


## Media types and encodings

Response media types, requested via the `Accept` header, are:

  * `application/json`
  * `application/json; schema=…`
  * `text/markdown`

Request media types (e.g. for PUT), declared by the request's `Content-Type`
header, are:

  * `application/json`
  * `text/markdown`

Request encodings, declared by the request's `Content-Encoding`, may be:

  * `gzip`
  * `deflate`


## Versioning

[Versioning][] is done at two levels.

First, the API endpoints themselves are versioned by inclusion of the major
version in the URL (`vX`).  Breaking changes will not be made without bumping
this version.  This document describes `v2` endpoints.

Second, the resource representations returned by the API are versioned by media
type parameters in the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers, enabling the use of
[content negotiation][].  For example, a client may include:

    Accept: application/json; schema="https://nextstrain.org/schema/augur-export-v2.json"

to ask for version 2 of `augur export` output.  Similarly, responses may
include a `schema` parameter indicating their format.

## Authentication

Requests are authenticated by one of two methods:

 1. A cookie associated with a logged-in web session, such as those set by
    nextstrain.org.  Cookies are usually automatically and transparently sent
    by the browser and thus Auspice.

 2. An `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header containing an identity (id)
    token, such as those managed by the `nextstrain login` command.

Third-party clients can be registered with us and then use our OAuth2 provider
at <https://login.nextstrain.org> in order to obtain tokens for a user.
