## Groups roadmap

- Web UI to manage existing members and roles and add *existing* users

- Self-service user sign up
  - Minimum
    - Toggle an option in Cognito (via Terraform)
    - A signup link on nextstrain.org?
    - Documentation?

  - Bonus: enable federated identity providers
    - e.g. Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.
    - or, maybe better for our audiences:
      - [InCommon](https://incommon.org/federation/) (many US institutions, including UW but unfortunately not Fred Hutch)
      - any EU equivalent to InCommon
        - ask .ch folks about this
        - maybe [Life Science Login](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/)?
        - maybe something from [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/)?

- Flow for adding a new person, i.e. without an existing user, to a group
  - Informal, unmanaged flow
    - Group owner tells people out-of-band to sign up so they can add them to their group
    - Invitees reply with their username
    - Owner adds them using member management interface
    - Document this as the flow
    - Upsides: little work on our part beyond self-service user sign up (see
      above); trust/safety/privacy issues are largely kept at arms length and
      in the hands of individuals; better match for [academic collaboration
      patterns](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/federation/understanding-r-and-e-collaboration)?
    - Downside: higher friction for users
  - Formal, managed flow
    - Send email inviting person to sign up as a new user
    - Upon signup, they're automatically joined to the group in the invited
      role.
    - Email used for invitation should not have to match email used for new
      user (so they can use an email address of their choosing).
    - Implementation-wise, it may be useful (or not) to create a provisional
      skeleton user in Cognito for the invitee, which is then fleshed
      out/updated as part of signup.
    - Upsides: lower friction for users; more like many SaaS flows they've seen before
    - Downsides: a lot more work on our part; taking on of several
      trust/safety/privacy issues
  - We can start with the informal flow and move to the formal flow later if we
    want.  This is what I would do.

- Self-service group creation
  - First: Do we want to do this?  Is it worth doing?
    - Even if we don't want to allow arbitrary groups, we could do this for
      ourselves/our own internal provisioning process (e.g. an admin panel).
    - We could opt for a midpoint of self-service group creation _requests_,
      which we then manually approve/deny/request changes of within an admin
      panel.
  - Move groups data out of a static file and into a database
    - Database is ideally Pg in the long run, but could be Redis (via our
      `src/kv.js` layer) for now as we don't need relations for now.  Downside
      is schemaless records and dealing with/avoiding drift.
    - [Replicated SQLite](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/) would be neat, but it
      introduces eventual consistency issues we probably don't want to care
      about.  It would be a better/easier option if we hosted on
      [Fly.io](https://fly.io), but given we're on Heroku, we should probably
      just go with [Heroku
      Postgres](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) (or _maybe_
      an external provider like [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/)).
  - Extend group name validation re: [appropriateness considerations](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/blob/15fdabd9bc019d0da2064ae61a26b96a7e649ec7/src/groups.js#L262-L276)
  - RESTful API endpoints (e.g. `PUT /groups/{name}`, and other methods for the rest of CRUD)
  - Web UI

- Mixed-access groups?
  - Per-resource authz tagging instead of groups being only public or only private
  - Relatedly: group-specific (i.e. user-defined) authz tags and roles and policies?
