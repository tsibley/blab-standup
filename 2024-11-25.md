## Pathogen version semantics

For this example, I'm using our `measles` pathogen, which we'll pretend has these versions:

    - main (latest development)
    - v3 (latest stable)
    - v2 (old stable)
    - v1 (older stable)
    - decafbad (specific revision)

Note that these are all valid Git refs.

```console
$ nextstrain setup measles      # Latest version, let's assume stable?, so v3
$ nextstrain setup measles@v2
$ nextstrain setup --set-default measles@v2
$ nextstrain setup measles@decafebad
$ nextstrain setup measles@main
$ nextstrain setup measles@fork=https://github.com/tsibley/measles/archive/refs/trs.zip
```

General syntax is `<name>@<version>`.

`<name>` without `<version>` means:

  - "latest (stable?) version" for `setup`
  - "local default version" for `run`
  - "change to latest (stable?) version" for `update`


## James' drafts for avian-flu

<https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/compare/james/config-schema>

`lambda w: resolve_config_path(p, w)` might be better as `resolve_config_path(p)`, where `resolve_config_path()` returns an input function that takes wildcard values.  This allows for late-binding of wildcards, which can be useful, and it's also more ergonomic for rule authoring.

Or alternatively, `lambda w: resolve_config_path(expand(p, w)[0])`, e.g. totally separate/isolate `resolve_config_path()` from wildcard handling.  In this case, ihe index access could also be simplified away by making `resolve_config_path()` do something like:

```python
if isinstance(p, str):
    return _resolve_config_path(p)
else:
    return list(map(_resolve_config_path, p))
```
