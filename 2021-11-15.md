- CLI
  - Uploads should set correct media type

- Wiki
  - Design docs
    - Groups design + roadmap
    - API design
    - Search (see email)
    - SQLite for ingest

  - Clean up test/example content
    - The false appearance of content is worse than the appearance of limited
      (but high-quality) content.

  - "Where do things go?" page

  - Three prongs of Nextstrain efforts
    1. R&D for advancing state-of-the-art in genomic epi and phylogenomic methods, visualization, and analysis ("research science")
    2. Maintaining high-quality core builds for pathogens of interest that are useful to public health, etc ("science in service"; our main "operations")
    3. Improving accessibility and expanding adoption of our techniques, software, etc. (development, outreach, documentation, trainings, user research, etc)

    - Engineering supports _all_ of these.

- Audit use of Cache-Control
  - nextstrain.org endpoints
  - S3 object metadata
  - Cloudfront distribution configuration

- Source classes
  - Reorg
  - Tests for behaviour

- Routing
  - Tests for behaviour

- Media types?
  - `application/vnd.nextstrain.dataset.main+json` instead of
    `application/vnd.nextstrain.main+json`?

- Track dataset/narrative cache hits/misses given new source changes?

- Redis counters for dataset/narrative requests
