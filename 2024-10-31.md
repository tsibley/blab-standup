⇒ Lab meeting! ⇐

Demo of [workflows as programs prototyping](2023-10-23.md).
See also [2023-07-17.md](2023-07-17.md).

## Todo

- [ ] Write up "analysis directory"
- [ ] Visual for separation of "workflow directory" (source code) and "analysis directory" (inputs/outputs)
- [ ] `nextstrain run [options] <pathogen> <workflow-name> <analysis-dir>`
- [ ] `nextstrain setup <pathogen>`
- [ ] `nextstrain update <pathogen>`
- [ ] Support `<pathogen>` of our shortnames for now, but eventually support
  third-party repos too.

- [ ] Is it weird to have `nextstrain setup` and `nextstrain update` work for
  pathogens as well as runtimes?  If so, we can introduce separation by nouns,
  e.g.

      nextstrain workflow {setup,update}
      nextstrain runtime {setup,update}

  but if we're going to preserve backwards compat (and I really think we
  should), then we'd still have `nextstrain {setup,update}` aliased to
  `nextstrain runtime {setup,update}` for a while (maybe indefinitely) and I
  wonder if that sort of defeats the point.
