# 7 February 2024
# or, pathogen automation

_Workflow definitions below are to give flavor to the ideas and a sense of what
they'd look like, not as fully-realized examples._

Introduce new reusable workflow

    .github/workflows/pathogen-repo-automation.yaml

which is called by our pathogen repos, e.g.

```yaml
name: Automation

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: …
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  automation:
    uses: nextstrain/.github/.github/workflows/pathogen-repo-automation.yaml@master
    secrets: inherit
    permissions:
      id-token: write
```

The reusable workflow will assume a repo adheres to the conventions of our
pathogen-repo-guide and coordinate the invocation of several
`pathogen-repo-build.yaml` jobs as appropriate, e.g.

```yaml
name: Pathogen repo automation

on:
  workflow_call:
    …

jobs:
  ingest:
    uses: nextstrain/.github/.github/workflows/pathogen-repo-build.yaml@…
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      run: nextstrain build ingest
      …
    permissions:
      id-token: write

  phylogenetic:
    needs: ingest
    if: needs.ingest.outputs.changed
    uses: nextstrain/.github/.github/workflows/pathogen-repo-build.yaml@…
    with:
      run: nextstrain build phylogenetic
      …
    secrets: inherit
    permissions:
      id-token: write
```

The details of what jobs are needed (e.g. a single `phylogenetic` job or
several independent `phylogenetic/{A,B,C}` jobs) and how to call them (e.g.
what goes in `with:`) can either be explicit inputs passed to
`pathogen-repo-automation.yaml` when called or read automatically from some
checked-in file, e.g. `nextstrain-pathogen.yaml`.

Importantly, orchestrating this all within a single GitHub Actions workflow
avoids the need for awkward repository dispatch linkages.  (Although we could
still do those too if we wanted I guess, but I'd recommend not.  The only
reason we used repository dispatches was because of the historic split of
ncov-ingest from ncov, so a single workflow wasn't an option!)

It might also behoove us to first prototype the use of GitHub Actions this way
without the reusable workflow layer, i.e. start with a repo or two and add a
workflow like the second example above.
