# or, Terra et al.

@huddlej and I had a productive garage session this morning learning a lot more
about WDL, Cromwell, miniwdl, Dockstore, Terra, and GCP.

- WDL
  - Must use `version 1.0` or you get an ancient "draft 2" version of the
    language!
  - WDL inputs are like Snakemake's config support: workflow/task params.
  - WDL options are like Snakemake's profile support: execution engine config.
  - Cromwell is a heavy-weight execution engine
    - Options
  - miniwdl is much lighter

- Dockstore
  - Describe WDL workflows in a .dockstore.yaml in our existing pathogen repos
  - Register repos with Dockstore
  - Push tags and branches to publish workflow releases to Dockstore
  - Provides workflows to environments like Terra
  - We'd want to
    [register](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/advanced-topics/organizations-and-collections.html)
    an [organization](https://dockstore.org/organizations) for Nextstrain.

- Terra
  - terra-billing@terra.bio must be added as a _Billing account user_ principal
    to your GCP _billing account_.

  - Terra _billing project_ is associated with a corresponding GCP _project_,
    which is in turn associated with a GCP _billing account_.

  - Terra _workspaces_ are associated with a Terra _billing project_.  Each
    workspace is associated with a GCP _storage bucket_, which Terra calls the
    _workspace bucket_.

Our next step is to prototype porting one of our pathogen builds to WDL,
probably zika-tutorial as a shakedown test.  The tutorial build will also be a
gentler way to introduce users to running Nextstrain builds on Terra and
complement our existing documentation flow.

I also think it's a reasonable next step for me to setup a GCP organization for
Nextstrain so that we have a shared foundation for testing and development of
integrations of our pathogen builds with Terra.  There's a bit of overhead here
to setup the billing and access/security, so probably easiest to do it once for
our whole team.  Maybe eventually we'll use Terra for production builds too?
