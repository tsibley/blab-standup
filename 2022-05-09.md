# or, data file assets for builds

In main dataset JSON, record asset map:

  asset name => asset hash

Names are conventional and have some structure, very similar to what we're
creating on /files/….

Asset hash is true ID, stored in S3.

Auspice/nextstrain.org shows generated table of assets for a dataset.

/files/… structure becomes a view on these: the latest versions of assets by
name for each dataset.

Make it easy to upload these assets and produce the asset map for the JSON.
