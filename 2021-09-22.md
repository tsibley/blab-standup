# or, â€¦

Steps:

  1. Fetch and ingest new upstream data. (ncov-ingest)
  2. Filter and align data. (ncov)
  3. Perform phylogenetics and Auspice build. (ncov)

Changes:

  - Stop running _ingest_ on every push to master, but keep for branches.
  - Add step to daily scheduled job (_fetch-and-ingest_) which triggers step 2.
  - Add step to daily scheduled job (_fetch-and-ingest_) which triggers step 3.

New things:

  - Move steps 2 and 3 as separate GH Actions workflows that live in the ncov
    repo and use `repository_dispatch`.

  - Make it easy to handle bad builds by reverting to yesterday's datasets,
    just by copying JSONs around.
