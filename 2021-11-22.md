- v1 to v2 dataset conversion service
  - GET https://nextstrain.org/convert/dataset
      - from=v1
      - to=v2
      - meta=url
      - tree=url

  - POST https://nextstrain.org/convert/dataset
      - from=v1
      - to=v2
      - meta=file
      - tree=file

  - Instead of doing this automatically/implicitly in `/charon/getDataset`?

  - And possibly by having `/charon/getDataset` redirect to conversion service
    when necessary?
