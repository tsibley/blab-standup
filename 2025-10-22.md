A big tension between the Source/Resource/Subresource framework and the
resourceIndexer/ResourceVersions/ListResources framework is that the former is
built around dynamically-constructed URLs (relying on, e.g., conventions and
external queries) while the latter is built around statically-constructed and
stored URLs.

The point they interact—`Subresource.url()` calls `Resource.versionInfo()`
which uses `Resource.versionDescriptor`—is awkward and ill-fitting because of
this tension.  These two very different ways of doing things collide and
subvert each other.

It would be clarifying to intentionally do things just one way.  Either:

 1. Move past version handling into Source/Resource/Subresource framework.

    ResourceVersions/ListResources go away and become part of Source/Resource
    instead as new methods and logic.  Possibly an additional ResourceVersion
    (singular!) class in the hierarchy.

    This doesn't preclude statically-constructing indexes of our resources; it
    means that indexes are _built_ and _used as part of_ the dynamic
    construction approach.  For example, resourceIndexer would _make (partial)
    use_ of Source/Resource/Subresource classes.

or

 2. Move all version handling, including "latest" (i.e. no version descriptor),
    into resourceIndexer/ResourceVersions/ListResources framework.

    Source/Resource/Subresource stop dynamically constructing URLs and _always_
    consult the resource index.  The resource index in turn needs to become a
    little more dynamic and be able to be updated in a more timely manner.

    This effectively makes the resource index much more like a live database we
    query as the source of truth.
