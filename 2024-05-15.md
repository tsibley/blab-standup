# or, …

- Groups across the line
    - spell this roadmap out

- AWS security/infra/Terraform

- resource indexing separation

- deployment improvements

- workflows as programs
    - separate state (inputs/outputs) from code (repo)
      - see also --no-upload issues/desires
      - <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths>
      - explicitly wrap all workflow-relative paths (e.g. scripts, default data, etc) in `workflow.source_path(…)` 
      - Then the separate state dir is provided via `--directory`.

    - per-repo deps
    - released artifacts (image + conda meta package)
    - all my previous notes/thinking/talks/etc on this topic
