- [x] does Azure AD care about port in redirects to localhost?
      nope! <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reply-url#localhost-exceptions>
      
      must register http://127.0.0.1 in manifest, not via gui
        <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reply-url#prefer-127001-over-localhost>

- [x] does Azure AD have limits on number of callback URLs?
      yes, but they're at least as large as Cognito:
          100 if consumer accounts
          256 if in Azure AD
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reply-url>

- [x] does Cognito support http://127.0.0.1 to avoid issues with localhost?
      nope! ugh. Azure does though

- [ ] OIDC metadata served by remote
- [ ] OIDC discovery from remotes
- [ ] per-remote credentials (good for dev too!)
- [ ] nextstrain.org-like remotes without env var (good for dev too!)
- [ ] nextstrain login to remotes
- [ ] nextstrain login via OIDC (without user/pass)
