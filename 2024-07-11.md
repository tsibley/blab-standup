## Augur i/o

Some basic testing seems to show that doing binary i/o thru Python isn't a
bottleneck, **as long as no serialization/deserialization into Python data
structures is happening**.

This means that we can use `augur.io.open_file()` and feed SQLite data via
Python without penalty.  One way is to arrange a pipe to SQLite's stdin and
feed data into it, another is with a new tiny utility command, `augur
read-file` which we can make SQLite invoke (e.g. with `.import '|augur
read-file …' table`).

That solves the "but how do we decompress, and efficiently so, the Augur
standard way?" problem.

## Bundling SQLite

In order to get full outer join support and be able to use the SQLite CLI, we
can initially set the expectation that `sqlite3` ≥3.39 is installed (just like
other external programs Augur requires).  In our runtimes, we'll ensure it is.

But as a future "It Just Works" improvement, we could totally bundle a
standalone `sqlite3` binary in Augur's Python wheels.
