# or, `nextstrain remote download` behaviour

Where should this command save files?

    nextstrain remote download nextstrain.org/groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A

I can imagine several options:

 1. Fully transform `/` → `_`:

        groups_blab_early-outbreak_root-A.json
        groups_blab_early-outbreak_root-A_tip-frequencies.json
        groups_blab_early-outbreak_root-A_root-sequence.json

    Easy to implement. Doesn't round trip if re-uploaded.

 2. Preserve containing source/namespace as directories:

        groups/blab/early-outbreak_root-A.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak_root-A_tip-frequencies.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak_root-A_root-sequence.json

    Round trips if re-uploaded.

 3. Preserve full hierarchy as directories:

        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A_tip-frequencies.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A_root-sequence.json

    Easy to implement. Doesn't round trip if re-uploaded. Matches URL, for
    maybe the least surprise.

 4. Preserve full hierarchy as directories, alternatively:

        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A/main.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A/tip-frequencies.json
        groups/blab/early-outbreak/root-A/root-sequence.json

    Ditto.

 5. Drop containing source/namespace, then `/` → `_`:

        early-outbreak_root-A.json
        early-outbreak_root-A_tip-frequencies.json
        early-outbreak_root-A_root-sequence.json

    Most like the original files uploaded and round trips if re-uploaded, but
    likely confusing/surprising (esp. to outsiders) to lose the namespacing and
    match with the URL.


Notes:

  - I'm assuming that the right interface for `nextstrain remote ${cmd}
    nextstrain.org/…` is the dataset/narrative/etc level since that's what
    specified by the nextstrain.org URLs.  Listings could, for example, show
    which sidecars exist for a dataset, though, so file-level information could
    still be surfaced in ways.

  - My assumption is that any sidecar files that exist should be downloaded by
    default (but this could be made optional or default to off).

  - The source/namespace part of the hierarchy in this case is `groups/blab/`,
    but in other cases it might be nothing (for core datasets like `zika`),
    `staging/`, or `community/blab/ncov-early-outbreak/` etc.

  - Round trip means downloading the files and re-uploaded them with
    `nextstrain remote upload`, which considers only filenames and not the
    directory path in which to-be-uploaded files reside.  I don't know if this
    is an expected use case, but stable round tripping is often a useful
    behaviour in a system.  I can imagine people round tripping files to make
    manual/automatic tweaks or to copy a dataset/narrative from a private group
    to a public group.
