## env vars and envdirs

I've had these env var-related experimental/WIP patches lingering in my local repo (and kicking
around my head) since the very beginnings of the Nextstrain CLI.  I've never
been fond of the existing approach for passing host env thru to the containers
managed by Nextstrain CLI, but on the other hand it's been Good Enough™ for a
few years now and it wasn't immediately clear these patches were no-downside
improvements and so it's never been a priority for me to revisit.

- [Add a "write-envdir" command to facilitate setting up environment directories](2022-08-26-Add-a-write-envdir-command-to-facilitate-setting-up-.patch)
- [runner.docker: Pass through all `NEXTSTRAIN_*` environment variables](2022-08-26-runner.docker-Pass-through-all-NEXTSTRAIN_-environme.patch)
- [runner.docker: Pass through most environment variables into the container](2022-08-26-runner.docker-Pass-through-most-environment-variable.patch)

There are other reasons too.  My original plan for the `nextstrain
write-envdir` command was that it'd integrate with workflows which explicitly
managed env vars via envdirs (and [the Python "envdir"
module](https://github.com/nextstrain/docker-base/commit/230e1db3366f1093534bbd186b31bb4a939427bf)),
but this stalled out because the appetite wasn't there on the workflow
authorship side.  See [my writeup from late July of
2018](https://github.com/tsibley/blab-standup/blob/master/2018-07-20.md).

In
any case, when we needed better env var management for ncov-ingest than was
otherwise available, I revived the idea and implemented it manually outside of
Nextstrain CLI using a small [`write-envdir` shell
program](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov-ingest/blob/20b4326/bin/write-envdir)
and [`nextstrain build`'s `--exec`
override](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov-ingest/blob/20b4326/.github/workflows/ingest-gisaid-master.yml#L38-L40).
It's been [on my
mind](https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=envdir+repo%3Atsibley%2Fblab-standup+path%3A%2F%5E202%5B12%5D-%2F),
lingering in the background, ever since.
