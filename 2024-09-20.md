## continuing Loculus exploration

_see also [yesterday](2024-09-19.md)_

I think we don't actually want Loculus as a whole, but really only want the
search page from the [Loculus
website](https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/tree/main/website/) + the
[LAPIS & SILO](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO) combo loaded with our
pathogen data.

The search page is client side React built with Astro and exclusively talks to
the LAPIS API, except for a few minor Loculus backend API endpoints.

The LAPIS & SILO index can be loaded from our own data directly (after some
transformation) without the dance of going thru the Loculus backend/database.

The rest of Loculus (backend, ingest, preprocessing, Pg¹, Keycloak) are simply
not needed for exposing our already-curated, already-aligned datasets
read-only.  And they're a heck of a lot of overhead, enough for me to say
"ditch 'em" instead of leaving them be and simply not using them.

(This all assumes we (Nextstrain) still want to present a read-only interface
 and _not_ a submission interface.)


¹ We might still need a Pg instance for LAPIS?  I think probably.  (Nope!)
