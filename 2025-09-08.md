## State of the Lab prep

 1. _Something that we’re doing well and that we should do more of_

    A focus and committment to not just moving the field forward thru
    development of new methods, technologies, etc. but also by **expanding
    access** to existing, well-used methods, technologies, etc. by putting them
    into more people's reach.  A philosophy that the work isn't done until it's
    in the hands of people using it.  Recognizing that things that are "stale"
    to those on the leading edge of research are still new to many many more
    practitioners who aren't.  Recognizing the power of steady incremental
    improvements over long periods of time.  This comes in the form of
    producing and continually improving "humane" software, striving for
    comprehensive documentation, partcipating in Q&A forums, running trainings,
    etc.

 2. _Something that we’re doing and we shouldn’t be doing (any sort of problem)_

    Conflating, to some extent, two different kinds of software development we
    might do in the lab:

     1. the "create new things {as part of, in support of, in response to} new science" kind, and
     2. the "improve and extend things related to the practice of existing science" kind.

    They're vastly different tasks with vastly different ways of working and
    vastly different goals and, IMO, are best thought of as completely separate
    activities even if they both involve a lot of software development.

    This conflation also seems like the root of the "science and dev sides are
    isolated" feeling.  The dev side does a lot of (2), while the science side
    does a lot of (1).  That's not inherently bad, but it seems clear how it
    leads to feeling of isolation ("we don't work on the same things").

 3. _Something new that we could be trialing_

    Internal internships?  e.g. removing someone from the Nextstrain team for
    1-3 months to focus on a Blab project?  (Or vice versa, but I suspect that
    is less appealing for career/academic timeline reasons?)

- [x] Thinking about State of the Lab

- [ ] Workflows as programs
      <https://github.com/nextstrain/public/issues/1>

  - [ ] Figure out interface we want for unmanaged local pathogens and managed
        third-party/private pathogens, as they’re related and decisions for one may
        affect the other (e.g. using slashes in name as sign of local path)

- [ ] Exposing Nextclade dataset trees via nextstrain.org automatically

- [ ] Fix `--download` and `--exclude-from-upload` to be aware of working dir vs. pathogen dir?
