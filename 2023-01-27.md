# or, collecting my thoughts

## small fry

- CLI: new Runtimes doc section (e.g. above/below Remotes); wip is `trs/docs/runtimes`

- ~Document published data files

## big fish

- [Groups membership management API](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextstrain.org/pull/581)
  - dev/testing infra
  - new user signup story

- [Goodbye, Gatsby!](2022-10-05.md)
  - our own simple thing?
  - buy into a framework?
    - <https://astro.build>?
    - something else?

- Automation system for production workflows
  - Something with a good management features
    - Probably Terra for strategic reasons?
    - maaaaybe AWS Batch + a custom dashboard on top, but there are significant downsides

  - Dashboard
    - one workflow per row
    - columns in reverse chronological order showing status of last N runs
    - deep links to logs, outputs, etc.

  - Plug-and-play, minimal setup for our pathogen build repos
    - e.g. add a stock GitHub Actions workflow and now you get scheduled builds
    - establish conventions for repo layout, etc.
    - similar to the bespoke automation we have for ncov/ncov-ingest and monkeypox
    - akin to how our pathogen repos all have CI now that's plug-and-play
