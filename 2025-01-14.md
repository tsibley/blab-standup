I can see where you're coming from, but I think what https://github.com/blab/embedded-pathways is trying to accomplish is pretty different from what Nextstrain's software is trying to accomplish.  Something you're solo hacking on over Christmas break in a private repo is pretty different from team-built published open-source software that's robust and stable.  (And, of course, there's a gradient/overlap/blurring of lines as things move from more like the former to more like the latter as they prove their worth.)

I think there's a huge gulf between "research software" (_not_ merely "software used for research") and "end-user software" (for lack of a better term).  Goals, non-goals, desired quality, development practices, cost:benefit judgments: all (and more) are often at odds between the two.  A lot of what makes it even possible to make end-user software good is the various strictures on how work happens.  Compared to more free-wheeling work environments (e.g. research-driven codebases, or personal or playful codebases), this can sometimes feel like having your hands tied or wading thru deep water (but hopefully not concrete).  It's worth it, though, at least when balanced, because it enables something bigger and longer lasting than being faster at producing more code: making something that works really well not just for you, on your computer, right now, but for many others, on their many other computers, now and into the future.

Research software's driving force is its research output.  End-user software's driving force is its users.


For whatever it's worth, I'm completely uninterested in working on a codebase where large parts of it were generated with LLMs.
