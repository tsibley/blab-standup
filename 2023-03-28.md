Strategy/goals doc

Productionized turn key build automation
On Terra? Prolly
Leveraging nextstrain.yaml file or whatever we want for buildpack stuff too

Nextstrain.org groups ui, search (deploy times, ditching Gatsby)

Workflows as programs, buildpacks

Sequence sharing without depositories, local GenBank in a box

## 3 

Workflows as programs
  Buildpacks, no git
  How does config and other params/files work?
  CI and other automation for them
  Increases access and adoption
  Increases ability to do more with the same people
  Enables more pathogen analyses


Dream of decentralized/federated sequence sharing


Want to tackle one of these strategic big projects
  Rationale for them
  Desire to move on, keep building on the foundations I’ve laid



Hiring
  Senior dev would be great
  “Bioinformatic engineer” who can dive in and take on the workflows would be great
  Community manager a plus


## 4

Declare PR review backlog bankruptcy

Workflows as programs
Do this now
Helps define our standard workflow form and interface, even before we handle arbitrary deps (eg buildpacks)

Ingest as part of our workflows
Prototype the first one so others can copy
Good QC is essential for full automation

Automation on Terra? Maybe, maybe not
May not be technical enough, eg around config cars





Augur curate can use pyparsing to move a pipeline into a single process
