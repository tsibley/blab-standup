# or, tokens in session


Before deploy:

- [ ] Adjust token lifetimes for "nextstrain.org prod" client in Cognito

- [ ] Decide what to do about old sessions.


Tested:

- New login
- No renewal required
- Successful renewal

- Failed renewal
  
  Outcome: user logged out but session preserved.  May be redirected to login
  page if req is for private resource.  If last login was recent enough, IdP
  may remember and issue new login automatically.

- Other failure (bug, service issue, network issue, etc.)

  Outcome: sparse Internal Server Error page.  Not friendly, but there's no
  super friendly outcome here.

  Could destroy the session when these failures happen, which would log out the
  affected user and make the site browseable to them in public mode (assuming
  other bits of the site aren't broken).  Is this more or less friendly than
  preserving their session and awaiting a fix from us?  This would presumably be
  a high priority incident if it occurred.  (Like the previous recent issue
  with sessions which we resolved temporarily by rolling back before rolling
  out a fix.)

- Two simultaneous reqs with valid sessions that needed token renewal.

  Outcome: two token renewal requests, both saved to session, last one in "wins".

  Good enough I suppose.

- Old session, sans tokens.
