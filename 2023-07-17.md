## "Making the most of version control" (August 2018)

Very first Bedford lab meeting I gave.  Most current folks haven't seen it.
Exceptions are Trevor, James, and John.  Reviewing it again, I think it'd be
beneficial to the rest of the lab.  And beneficial for Trevor/James/John to
participate in discussion around ideas in it, share their experiences with the
practices, etc.  And while Jover and Victor haven't seen the talk, they do
routinely practice what it promotes and could easily discuss/share experiences
as well.

Unfortunately, a decent number of folks out tomorrow makes it a
less-than-compelling time to present it as several folks who I think would have
an interest/benefit are absent.


## Data tools, e.g. like VisiData

(suggested by Cassia, seconded by Miguel)

VisiData talk a while ago was really helpful to folks, and they've started
using it frequently.  What else do I know like that?

Appealing to me, but what would these be?  daff?  csv-diff?  Neither seem
substantial enough for a 40 minute talk by themselves…  jq too?  Git
integration.

Maybe could expand to "Diffs" as a topic itself?  Diff-based thinking.  Get the
computer to diff it for you.  Patches.  Applying patches.  Diffs and patches
for ~any format.

  - diff/patch for any text, lowest common denominator, not specialized
  - daff for tabular data
  - deepdiff for Python data structures (at things that serde those, JSON, YAML, etc)
  - compare (from ImageMagick), pixelmatch, etc. for image diffs

There's a good talk here… but I think a chunk of the core audience will be
absent this week!  Bummer.  Another time then…


## nextstrain.org big picture

(suggested by John)

Audience seems unusually amenable to this topic given who's absent!  Hmm…

But is there enough there?


## Workflows as programs, II

Driven by audience seeming unusually appropriate…

Revisiting my [past lab meeting][] on this, but with more concrete details on
the interface and less about how we might achieve it.

This gets at "workflow interface" questions recently raised.
