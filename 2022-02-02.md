# or, Thoughts on triage

I'm not sure the currently forming process for bug triage is heading in the
right direction.  It seems we're doing:

 1. Walk through repos, looking at new issues in some ~arbitrary time frame but
    ostensibly "since last time we did this".

 2. Talk about each, add some to board and label them with "user pain", leave
    others as is.

 3. Roughly work on issues from the board's backlog.

But this single threads ~7 people's time and doesn't seem to acknowledge the
reality that we do a lot of work not represented by our labels or even our
issues.

I think instead that our planning board should be focused on strategic goals or
changes that are bigger picture than issues, with issues present there but
taking a backseat instead of the primary thing.

Instead of triaging issues as a separate process and then working down that
list, triage as they come in (whoever does it first).  Then work on issues as
they relate to features (strategic, goal-oriented, future-driven) or other
strategic goals.

**Update 15 Feb**: Triage is changing so that we'll default to adding things to
board and triaging from there.  This helps a bit, but is still not focused on
strategic, longer-term, bigger-picture planning.
