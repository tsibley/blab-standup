# 14 June 2024
# or, merging

_[motivating context in Slack](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C7SDVPBLZ/p1715905305514319), plus more notes [in Slack](https://bedfordlab.slack.com/archives/C01LCTT7JNN/p1718732379157669)_

Features

  1. 2+ metadata inputs
  2. Support `--metadata-id-columns`
  3. Support `--metadata-delimiters` with internal calls to `_get_delimiter()` (requires seekability)
  4. Join keys are always id column
  5. Column coalescing/overwriting
  6. Record source file(s) of rows in extra columns
  7. Support Augur's standard accepted compression formats


Questions

  1. Are inputs named?  (c.f. ncov's `combine_metadata.py`'s `--origins`)

  2. How do we want to handle null/empty values?  e.g. can the right-hand side
     blank out the left-hand side?  Maybe by the Augur convention of `?`
     meaning null/unknown?  (e.g. applying `nullif(column_x, '?')` to each
     column before coalescing; unfortunately `.import` doesn't respect
     `.nullvalue`)

     Or use [my patch for `.import --nulls`](https://gist.github.com/tsibley/ce5c64af5feef54303c03cc56f590154)?

  3. Duplicate warnings, a la `augur filter`?

  4. Do we need to _actually_ support sequence merging?  Or can we punt on it
     (i.e. say no to supporting sequence patches) and defer sequence filtering
     based on merged metadata to `augur filter`?

     pathogen-repo-guide doesn't need this for merge of Nextclade columns.
     ncov doesn't need this for `combine_metadata.py`

  5. Is the SQLite approach above even workable as-is given it wasn't until
     mid-way thru 2017 that SQLite [gained support for full outer
     joins](https://sqlite.org/changes.html#version_-3_39_0)?

     What's the workaround look like?


Implementations, possibly.

 1. Read metadata into temporary SQLite db, do join/merge there.

        .mode csv
        .separator \t \n
        .import '|unzstd < metadata.tsv.zst' metadata_a
        create unique index metadata_a_strain on metadata_a(strain);

        .mode csv
        .separator , \n
        .import 'additional-metadata.csv' metadata_b
        create unique index metadata_b_id on metadata_b(id);

        pragma optimize=0x10002;

        -- Read column names for set calculations to figure out what to select
        select name from pragma_table_info('metadata_a');
        select name from pragma_table_info('metadata_b');

        -- Join
        select
          coalesce(metadata_b.id, metadata_a.strain) as strain,

          -- Columns in both/all
          coalesce(metadata_b.

          -- Columns only in one
          metadata_a.… as …,
          metadata_b.… as …,

          -- Source columns
          metadata_a.strain is not null as __source_metadata_a,
          metadata_b.id is not null as __source_metadata_b
          
        from
          metadata_a outer join metadata_b on (metadata_a.strain = metadata_b.id)
        ;

  However, the `sqlite3` CLI commands (`.mode`, `.import`, et al.) are not
  available to a standard database connection outside the CLI.
  
  Can we still use them somehow?

  Maybe shelling out to `sqlite3` ourselves?  (And bundling it with Augur?)

  Or if not that, can we still avoid reading disk → Python → SQLite during
  the import (i.e. excise Python from the import)?

  Separately, maybe consider opening the metadata files in Python (with
  standard auto de-compression, delimiter detection, etc.) but then passing the
  underlying fds to SQLite's `.import` as `/dev/fd/N`.


## Why not…

 1. A [CSV virtual table](https://sqlite.org/csv.html)?

    It's slow.  SQLite doesn't permit indexes on virtual tables.

 2. A [XSV virtual table](https://observablehq.com/@asg017/introducing-sqlite-xsv)?

    Presumably faster (I haven't tried), but still will be limited by being on
    disk without indexes.  But maybe I should test to be sure!

    Also, explicitly marked as pretty experimental and beta and not safe.

 3. Augur's `read_metadata()` piped into SQLite
    (via [Python's bindings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html))
    via generated `CREATE TABLE` + `INSERT` statements?

    My assumption is that it's by definition going to be slower due to
    involving Python and more copying of data.  (But maybe not!)  If we need a
    bundled SQLite version, it's also harder to make that work with Python's
    bindings.
