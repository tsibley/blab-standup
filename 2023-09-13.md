# or, â€¦

- not take home, but in person (or over zoom)
  - real time to answer questions, help guide, produce a good test rather than a bad one

- explaining download CLI endpoints on nextstrain.org
  - no need to build gatsby or auspice
  - do need node v16
  - readme has instructions
  - may need to provide a `GITHUB_TOKEN` (with very limited access; no scopes please!)
    - a good talking point itself
