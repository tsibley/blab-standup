# or, Groups

Nextstrain Groups is a feature that allows research labs, public health
entities, and other organizations to share their Nextstrain datasets and
narratives directly on nextstrain.org within the context of a named “group”.
Groups can be shared publicly or privately.

~30 groups and ~130 users in ~200 memberships (some users are in multiple
groups).

- New nextstrain.org web API for managing datasets and narratives in Groups

- Support in Nextstrain CLI for this new web API
  - Management of Groups with just nextstrain.org credentials; separate Amazon
    S3 credentials are no longer needed.

- New membership roles within a Group (owner, editor, viewer)
  - Underpinnings are flexible so this can adapt as needed in the future to new
    resource types, new actions/permissions, new roles, etc.

- Overhauled Groups and related CLI documentation including explanatory
  material, how-to guides, and reference information.

- All steps towards self-service creation and increasing self-service
  management of Groups.

  It simplifies the management of Groups for both users and ourselves,
  primarily by removing the need to setup and keep track of a separate set of
  AWS credentials for each group. It also makes it easier for us to provision
  new groups, which is an important step in making Nextstrain Groups more
  widely available.

- The new web API is also a future integration point for complementary
  third-party services, e.g. could be used to upload a dataset generated on
  behalf of a user by CZ Gen Epi.

- Next step: Contact and start migrating Groups over.

- To come: API and web UI to manage members

- To come? Web UI for managing datasets and narratives.
  - Ties into narrative authoring too.
